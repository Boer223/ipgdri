This study identified a natural variation of *RLK902* conferring resistance to SRD and GMD in a natural population of *B. napus*. Importantly, knocking out *RLK902* by genome editing displayed a higher level of disease resistance in *B. napus*. We also elucidated that JA-mediated immunity underlay this resistance of rlk902 mutant. Therefore, this study provides a valuable gene and materials for genetic improvement of SRD and GMD resistance in *B. napus* and new insights into understanding the mechanisms of the plant resistance against necrotrophic pathogens.
