[BnaOmics](https://bnaomics.ocri-genomics.net/) is a comprehensive central platform for genomics, transcriptomics, epigenomics, and variations in *Brassica napus* (*B. napus*). It integrates 26 *B. napus* reference genomes, re-sequencing data of 2,885 accessions, 8,736,523 high-quality SVs, 112,886 high-quality presence/absence variants (PAVs), thousands of transcriptomes, and hundreds of epigenomes. Several common, easy-to-use toolkits were developed, including Gene converter, Genome browser, Pan-genome browser, Epigenome browser, BLAST, Gene PAV view, Sequence retrieval, GWAS view, Gene expression view and GO/KEGG enrichment.
