The **Innovation Program of Genomics & Disease Resistance Improvement** at [Oil Crops Research Institute](https://ocri.caas.cn/index.htm) of [Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences](https://www.caas.cn/) is working on a serious of topics in polyploid genomes evolution and disease resistance improvement of *Brassica napus* (甘蓝型油菜, rapeseed, oilseed rape), including:
1. **Evolution of Polyploid Brassiceae Genomes**. We have completed the de novo genome assembly and pangenome construction of *Brassica* genus, uncovered excellent genetic loci for important traits, and revealed the asymmetric evolution of polyploid subgenomes.
2. **Genome Design Breeding System**. Integrating the multi-omics data of thousands of *B. napus* accessions, we investigate and constructed the regulatory mechanism and network of important agronomic traits. Combining with genome synthetic biology technology, we created a series of germplasm resources for breeding, such as the high glucosinolate content in vegetative tissues but low in seeds. Now, we are working on building the genome design breeding platform/system to efﬁciently and rapidly design and improve the future rapeseed crops with great increased productivity and proﬁtability.
3. **Green and Efficient Control of Brassica napus Diseases**. We have solved the world-wide problem of the infestation cycle of *Brassica napus* rhizomatosis; cloned for the first time broad-spectrum recessive and dominant disease resistance genes, and bred several disease-resistant, high-yielding and high-quality *Brassica napus* lines; developed chemical pesticide reduction technology for *Brassica napus* pests and weeds and its green, efficient and light control technology system.
