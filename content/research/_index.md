### Evolution of Polyploid Brassiceae Genomes
We have completed the de novo genome assembly and pangenome construction of *Brassica* genus, uncovered excellent genetic loci for important traits, and revealed the asymmetric evolution of polyploid subgenomes.

### Genome Design Breeding System
Integrating the multi-omics data of thousands of *B. napus* accessions, we investigate and constructed the regulatory mechanism and network of important agronomic traits. Combining with genome synthetic biology technology, we created a series of germplasm resources for breeding, such as the high glucosinolate content in vegetative tissues but low in seeds. Now, we are working on building the genome design breeding platform/system to efﬁciently and rapidly design and improve the future rapeseed crops with great increased productivity and proﬁtability.

### Green and Efficient Control of Brassica napus Diseases
We have solved the world-wide problem of the infestation cycle of *Brassica napus* rhizomatosis; cloned for the first time broad-spectrum recessive and dominant disease resistance genes, and bred several disease-resistant, high-yielding and high-quality *Brassica napus* lines; developed chemical pesticide reduction technology for *Brassica napus* pests and weeds and its green, efficient and light control technology system.
