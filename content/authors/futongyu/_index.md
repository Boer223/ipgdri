Clubroot is a world wide disease by Pb（*Plasmodiophora brassicae Woronin*） effact the root of *Brassicacea*,which is a soil-borne disease. My research work is finding the broad-spectrum clubroot resistance genes  from the *Raphanus sativus L.* and analysing the mechanism of the broad-spectrum resistance genes, furthermore, using molecular techniques to generate the resistance of *Brassica*.
