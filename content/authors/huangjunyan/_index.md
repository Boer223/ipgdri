Sclerotinia stem rot is a devastating disease in most of the oilseed rape producing countries worldwide, and is a major factor limiting yield potential and reducing seed quality of oilseed rape in China. To exploit and utilize plant resistant genes to prevent and control *Sclerotinia* disease (SD),  our research focus on genetic mechanism  of SD resistance and related agronomic traits in *Brassica napus*.
