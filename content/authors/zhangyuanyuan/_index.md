Dr. Yuanyuan Zhang is working on development of genome design breeding system and understanding the asymmetrical polyploid genome evolution, especially in subgenome diploidization and diversification. He integrates the genomic, transcriptomics, metabolic, phenotypic and epigenomic data of thousands of *B. napus* accessions to facilitate genome design breeding. As a part of these he and his partners using a mixture of big data analysis, functional genetics, plant biology, evolutionary biology and transcript/metabolite profiling to develop as in depth and broad a picture as possible.
- *Brassica napus* population genomics reveals asymmetrical allopolyploid diploidization and diversification.
- Developing the crop genome design breeding platform/system.
- Genome-wide association study to dissect the genetic regulation of metabolism and resistance to *Sclerotinia sclerotiorum* in *Brassica napus*.
- Cis- and trans-effect of genome structural variation on gene expression and trait formation in *Brassica napus*.
- Exploiting glucosinolate biosynthesis and transport pathway in *Brassicaceae*.
- Improving the pedigree breeding with genome synthetic biology in *Brassica napus*.
