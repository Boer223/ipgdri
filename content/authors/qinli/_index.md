Li Qin, Investigator.

I am broadly interested in the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying plant-fungi interactions. I have systematically elucidated the mechanisms of phosphoinositide as a susceptibility factor to promote pathogenic infection, the fine regulation of plant cytoskeleton in disease resistance, and the cellular and genetic regulation of cell wall lignification in defense against fungal penetration.

My research is currently focused on understanding the mechanisms by which the effectors of *Sclerotinia sclerotiorum* trigger the necrosis during infection of *Brassica napus*, and the genetic mechanism regulating host’s susceptibility and/or resistance against sclerotinia
