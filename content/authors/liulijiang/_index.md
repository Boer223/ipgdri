Clubroot disease caused by *Plasmodiophora brassicae* is a devastating disease to *Brassicaceae* crops. Our aim is to exploit and utilize plant resistant genes to prevent and control this notorious disease and our current research directions mainly include: 
- Exploiting clubroot disease resistant materials and genes; 
- Understanding the underlying clubroot resistance mechanisms and plant-*P. brassicae*(clubroot disease pathogen) interactions; 
- Developing integral techniques to prevent and control the clubroot disease.
