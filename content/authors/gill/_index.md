*Brassica napus* L. is a tetraploid crop is ranked second among oilseed crops cultivated around the globe and consumed as edible oil for human consumption, and seed cake for animals. To feed the growing population (~10 billion in 2050), there is utmost need to improve the rapeseed crop, keeping in mind both environmental and developmental cues. In case of environmental cues, Dr. Gill had experiences (in the past) in the areas of plant stress physiology, biochemistry, and molecular biology. Regarding developmental cues, he is currently working on an NSFC-funded project related to the area of population genomics. In this project, he mainly wanted to find the candidate QTLs targeting phenotypic traits (a total of 28) related to growth stages including flowering, plant architecture and seed yield, seed oil content and oil quality. Additionally, he also has interest in the areas of epigenetics and polyploidy. 
#### Funding

The projected granted by National Natural Science Foundation of China (31950410560), International (Regional) Cooperation and Exchange Project, The Research Fund for International Young Scientists, 2020.1-2021-12.
2. Small non-coding RNAs encyclopedia explores the nuclear regulatory proteins networks under chromium stress mediated by reduced glutathione in *Brassica napus* L. The projected granted by National Natural Science Foundation of China (3161101176), the research fund for international young scientists, 2017.1-2018.12.
3. Regulating mechanism of salicylic acid and reduced glutathione under the chromium stress in *Brassica napus*. The project granted by Post-Doctoral Science Foundation of China (2016M592004), 11.5.2016.
