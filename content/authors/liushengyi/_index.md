My research interest and commitments are disease resistance and control, genetics and genomics, and breeding by genome design. 

For disease resistance and control, my commitment is to develop green and sustainable measures for controlling the two major diseases in oilseed rape, mold diseased/stem rot caused by *Sclerotinia sclerotiorum* and clubroot caused by *Plasmodiophora brassicae*, mainly by use of plant resistance.

For genomics, my interest is to understand polyploid genome evolution and to explore new breeding technology using genomics.
