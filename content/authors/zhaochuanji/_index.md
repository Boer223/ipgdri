Insufficient genetic loci for high density and high yield restrict the green revolution in the rapeseed industry. Our aim is to utilize the *Brassica napus* germplasm resource to dissect plant architecture by association and linkage analysis combined with multiple-omics methods in *Brassica napus*, and our current research directions mainly include:
- Exploiting the ideal plant architecture materials and underlying genes in *Brassica napus*.
- Understanding the underlying the mechanism of ideal plant architecture formation, and building a molecular regulatory network for the formation, variation and improvement of plant architecture.
- Potential assessment and breeding application of ideal plant architecture materials and underlying genes.

#### Funding
- Genetic architecture dissection for plant height and cloning of semi-dwarf genes in superior plant architecture in *Brassica napus*. 300,000, National Science Foundation of China, 32101813, 2022.1-2024.12
