He is currently focuses on:
- Working on *Sclerotinia sclerotiorum* resistance in *Brassica napus*.
-	Exploiting glucosinolate biosynthesis and transport pathway in Brassica napus.
-	Creating excellent germplasm resources based on genetic mechanism of important agronomic traits by using genome editing tools and traditional genetic approaches.
