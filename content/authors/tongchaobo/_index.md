My research is focused on crop genomics and bioinformatics. We aim to reveal the genomic evolution of polyploid *B. napus* during genetic breeding and identified the causal loci/genes regulating key traits for accelerating the breeding of elite cultivars.  Based on multi-omics data and bioinformatics tools/skills, our recent work was focused on: 
- The structure and evolution of polyploid *B. napus* genomes on species-level and population level based on comparative genomics and multi-omics data.
- The discovery of genetic loci or functional genes for important traits (e.g. disease resistance, flowering time, plant architecture, yield, oil content and quality, etc.) and based on GWAS and QTL analyses, and the following dissection of molecual mechanism for regulating key traits.
- The construction of genomic design breeding technology and platform aimed for accelerating the breeding of elite cultivars.
