abstract: 'High contents of oil，protein，and phenolic as well as the characteristics
  of easy oxidation make it a challenge for RNA extraction from seeds of oil crops
  as rapeseed，soybean，peanut and sesame． To overcome the problems，a modified RNA extraction
  method was constructed based on commercial RNA extraction kit． Three prominent procedures
  were optimized as: 1． Added antioxidant materials mercaptoethanol and PVP during
  RNA ex- traction; 2． Adjusted chloroform amount according to oil content of the
  samples; 3． Modified RNA precipitate step by increasing elution volume before alcohol
  precipitating． The modified RNA extraction method showed more effi- cient with fine
  quality and higher quantity of RNA than that of CTAB，TRIZOL and RNA extraction kit
  methods for all four species at different seed developmental periods especially
  at late periods． Moreover，Q － PCR analysis re- sult showed that the differentially
  expression patterns of FAD2 gene ( in four oil seeds at different periods) could
  well be reflected using the RNA extracted by the modified method．'
