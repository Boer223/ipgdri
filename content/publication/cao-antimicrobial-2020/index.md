abstract: Through the method of bioinformatics, in this study, the sequencing data
  of the tissue transcription group of Brassica napus and the database of antimicrobial
  peptides have been obtained, and a new antimicrobial peptide gene BnCRP1 which harbored
  102 bp encoding 34 amino acids has been got. There were 9 cysteines in the BnCRP1
  sequence, and the cysteine content exceeded 27%. It was a new type of cysteine-enriched
  antimicrobial peptide（Cystine rich peptide, CRP） which derived from plants belonging
  to the Knottin-like peptides in the classification of antimicrobial peptides. Antimicrobial
  activity demonstrated that BnCRP1 exhibited strong antimicrobial activity against
  Gram-positive bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria and yeast. BnCRP1 also had strong
  antifungal activity against Sclerotinia sclerotiorum. BnCRP1 has been proved to
  significantly enhance the resistance of plants to saprotrophic fungal Sclerotinia
  sclerotiorum in vitro leaf grafting experiments of Arabidopsis. It can be used as
  a biocontrol preparation for the prevention and treatment of sclerotinia, and can
  also be used as a new gene source for plant genetic engineering to cultivate disease-resistant
  transgenic plants. This study laid a foundation for the large-scale identification
  of antimicrobial peptides from new plants by bioinformatics and genetic engineering.
