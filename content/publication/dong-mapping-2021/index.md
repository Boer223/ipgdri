abstract: Plant height is a crucial element related to plant architecture that influences
  the seed yield of oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.). In this study, we isolated a
  natural B. napus mutant, namely a semi-dwarf mutant (sdw-e), which exhibits a 30%
  reduction in plant height compared to Zhongshuang 11-HP (ZS11-HP). Quantitative
  trait locus sequencing (QTL-seq) was conducted using two extreme DNA bulks in F2
  populations in Wuchang-2017 derived from ZS11-HP × sdw-e to identify QTLs associated
  with plant height. The result suggested that two QTL intervals were located on chromosome
  A10. The F2 population consisting of 200 individuals in Yangluo-2018 derived from
  ZS11-HP × sdw-e was used to construct a high-density linkage map using whole-genome
  resequencing. The high-density linkage map harbored 4323 bin markers and covered
  a total distance of 2026.52 cM with an average marker interval of 0.47 cM. The major
  QTL for plant height named qPHA10 was identified on linkage group A10 by interval
  mapping (IM) and composite interval mapping (CIM) methods. The major QTL qPHA10
  was highly consistent with the QTL-seq results. And then, we integrated the variation
  sites and expression levels of genes in the major QTL interval to predict the candidate
  genes. Thus, the identified QTL and candidate genes could be used in marker-assisted
  selection for B. napus breeding in the future.
