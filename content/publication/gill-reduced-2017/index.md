abstract: Chromium (Cr) as a toxic metal is widely used for commercial purposes and
  its residues have become a potential environmental threat to both human and plant
  health. Oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.) is one of the candidate plants that can
  absorb the considerable quantity of toxic metals from the soil. Here, we used two
  cultivars of B. napus cvs. ZS 758 (metal-tolerant) and Zheda 622 (metal-susceptible)
  to investigate the phenological attributes, cell ultrastructure, protein kinases
  (PKs) and molecular transporters (MTs) under the combined treatments of Cr stress
  and reduced glutathione (GSH). Seeds of these cultivars were grown in vitro at different
  treatments i.e., 0, 400 μM Cr, and 400 μM Cr + 1 mM GSH in control growth chamber
  for 6 days. Results had confirmed that Cr significantly reduced the plant length,
  stem and root, and fresh biomass such as leaf, stem and root. Cr noticeably caused
  the damages in leaf mesophyll cells. Exogenous application of GSH significantly
  recovered both phenological and cell structural damages in two cultivars under Cr
  stress. For the PKs, transcriptomic data advocated that Cr stress alone significantly
  increased the gene expressions of BnaA08g16610D, BnaCnng19320D, and BnaA08g00390D
  over that seen in controls (Ck). These genes encoded both nucleic acid and transition
  metal ion binding proteins, and protein kinase activity (PKA) and phosphotransferase
  activities in both cultivars. Similarly, the presence of Cr revealed elite MT genes
  [BnaA04g26560D, BnaA02g28130D, and BnaA02g01980D (novel)] that were responsible
  for water transmembrane transporter activity. However, GSH in combination with Cr
  stress significantly up-regulated the genes for PKs [such as BnaCnng69940D (novel)
  and BnaC08g49360D] that were related to PKA, signal transduction, and oxidoreductase
  activities. For MTs, BnaC01g29930D and BnaA07g14320D were responsible for secondary
  active transmembrane transporter and protein transporter activities that were expressed
  more in GSH treatment than either Ck or Cr-treated cells. In general, it can be
  concluded that cultivar ZS 758 is more tolerant toward Cr-induced stress than Zheda
  622.
