abstract: 'Objective: Sclerotinia stem rot (SSR) caused by Sclerotinia sclerotiorum
  is a damaging disease of oilseed rape. The sensitivity of S. sclerotiorum to prochloraz-manganese
  chloride (PMC) and the other three fungicides, carbendazim, dimetachlone-mancozeb
  and carbendazim-triadimefon was tested. The aim of this study was to assess the
  potential of PMC in controlling SSR and to screen novel fungicides...'
