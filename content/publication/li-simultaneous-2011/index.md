abstract: 'INTRODUCTION: Plant hormones are important signalling molecules that act
  at lower concentrations to regulate numerous plant physiological and developmental
  processes. In order to study the functions of plant hormones, it is necessary to
  develop a high-throughput and highly selective and sensitive method for determination
  of plant hormones. OBJECTIVE: Based on SPE-HPLC-ESI-MS/MS method, a highly selective
  and sensitive method for determination of six plant hormones in leaf tissue of oilseed
  rape was developed. METHODOLOGY: The extraction was performed with C₁₈ solid-phase
  extraction cartridge and the sample was subsequently analysed by HPLC-ESI-MS/MS.
  Methanol and H₂O with 0.05% formic acid was selected as the mobile phase for HPLC,
  using a gradient of increasing methanol content. The plant hormones were quantified
  in MRM mode and identified in IDA mode by the hybrid triple quadrupole/linear ion
  trap mass spectrometer with high sensitivity and selectivity. RESULTS: Under the
  optimal conditions, good linearities were obtained for six plant hormones with the
  correlation coefficients above 0.9924. The detection limits of the target compounds
  were in the range of 0.005-0.2 ng/mL. Reproducibility of the method was obtained
  with intra-day and inter-day relative standard deviations. The extraction recovery
  yields of plant hormones under SPE conditions ranged from 67.03 to 119.83%. Compared
  with previous methods, sample preparation time and amount of sample required for
  analysis of plant hormones were reduced, and more classes of hormones were quantitatively
  measured.'
