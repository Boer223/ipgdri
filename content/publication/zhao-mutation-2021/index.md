abstract: Oilseed rape (Brassica napus) with yellow flowers is an attractive ornamental
  landscape plant during the flowering period, and the development of different petal
  colors has become a breeding objective. Although yellowish flower color is a common
  variant observed in field-grown oilseed rape, the genetics behind this variation
  remains unclear. We obtained a yellowish-white flower (ywf) mutant from Zhongshuang
  9 (ZS9) by ethyl methanesulfonate mutagenesis (EMS) treatment. Compared with ZS9,
  ywf exhibited a lower carotenoid content with a reduced and defective chromoplast
  ultrastructure in the petals. Genetic analysis revealed that the yellowish-white
  trait was controlled by a single recessive gene. Using bulked-segregant analysis
  sequencing (BSA-seq) and kompetitive allele-specific PCR (KASP), we performed map-based
  cloning of the ywf locus on chromosome A08 and found that ywf harbored a C-to-T
  substitution in the coding region, resulting in a premature translation termination.
  YWF, encoding phytoene desaturase 3 (PDS3), was highly expressed in oilseed rape
  petals and involved in carotenoid biosynthesis. Pathway enrichment analysis of the
  transcriptome profiles from ZS9 and ywf indicated the carotenoid biosynthesis pathway
  to be highly enriched. Further analyses of differentially expressed genes and carotenoid
  components revealed that the truncated BnaA08.PDS3 resulted in decreased carotenoid
  biosynthesis in the mutant. These results contribute to an understanding of the
  carotenoid biosynthesis pathway and manipulation of flower-color variation in B.
