abstract: In this research，a novel membrane extraction was coupled with gas chromatograph
  (GC) for identification and quantifcation of MJA in leaf for analysis of early signaling
  in oilseed rape resistance to Sclerotinia sclerotiorum. In view of the simplictity，sensitivity，and
  excellent quantitation，the novel analysis method was recommended. Excellent method
  of reproducibility was found over a linear range of 1~1000ng/mL, with the correlation
  coefficient 0.9985. Good recovery (93%) was obtained with RSD 9.5%. LOD was 0.2ng/mL，which
  were found to be more than adequate for the usual analytical requirements for MJA
  in plant tissues. Furthermore, the analysis method was successfully applied for
  the determination of MJA released by inoculated leaf tissue of oilseed rape.
