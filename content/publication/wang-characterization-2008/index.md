abstract: Arabidopsis MPK4 plays an important role in disease resistance.We cloned
  and characterized Brassica napus MPK4（BnMPK4）,and found that the BnMPK4 protein
  was comprised of 373 amino acid residues with a conserved motif T201E202Y203 and
  a CD domain（common docking domain）,and was 95% identical with Arabidopsis MPK4.Using
  quantitative RT-PCR,we analyzed BnMPK4 expression changes in oilseed rape after
  treatment with the chemicals BTH、MeJA or oxalic acid,or inoculation with the fungi
  Sclerotinia sclerotiorum.The results showed that BnMPK4 expression were promptly
  activated by BTH and suppressed by MeJA.The gene expression was promptly activated
  in both OA and S.sclerotiorum treatment and trends of expression changes were consistent.These
  results suggested that BnMPK4 in oilseed rape plays a role in defense against S.sclerotiorum.
