abstract: As a soilborne protist pathogen, Plasmodiophora brassicae causes the devastating
  clubroot disease on Brassicaeae crops worldwide. Due to its intracellular obligate
  biotrophic nature, the life cycle of P. brassicae is still not fully understood.
  Here, we used fluorescent probe-based confocal microscopy and transmission electron
  microscopy (TEM) to investigate the infection process of P. brassicae on the susceptible
  host Arabidopsis under controlled conditions. We found that P. brassicae can initiate
  the primary infection in both root hairs and epidermal cells, producing the uninucleate
  primary plasmodium at 1 day postinoculation (dpi). After that, the developed multinucleate
  primary plasmodium underwent condensing and cytoplasm cleavage into uninucleate
  zoosporangia from 1 to 4 dpi. This was subsequently followed by the formation of
  multinucleate zoosporangia and the production of secondary zoospores within zoosporangium.
  Importantly, the secondary zoospores performed a conjugation in the root epidermal
  cells after their release. TEM revealed extensive uninucleate secondary plasmodium
  in cortical cells at 8 dpi, indicating the establishment of the secondary infection.
  The P. brassicae subsequently developed into binucleate, quadrinucleate, and multinucleate
  secondary plasmodia from 10 to 15 dpi, during which the clubroot symptoms appeared.
  The uninucleate resting spores were first observed in the cortical cells at 24 dpi,
  marking the completion of a life cycle. We also provided evidence that the secondary
  infection of P. brassicae may represent the diploid sexual life stage. From these
  findings, we propose a refined life cycle of P. brassicae which will contribute
  to understanding of the complicated infection biology of P. brassicae.
