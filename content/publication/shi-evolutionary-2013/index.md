abstract: Despite their ubiquity and functional importance, microsatellites have been
  largely ignored in comparative genomics, mostly due to the lack of genomic information.
  In the current study, microsatellite distribution was characterized and compared
  in the whole genomes and both the coding and non-coding DNA sequences of the sequenced
  Brassica, Arabidopsis and other angiosperm species to investigate their evolutionary
  dynamics in plants. The variation in the microsatellite frequencies of these angiosperm
  species was much smaller than those for their microsatellite numbers and genome
  sizes, suggesting that microsatellite frequency may be relatively stable in plants.
  The microsatellite frequencies of these angiosperm species were significantly negatively
  correlated with both their genome sizes and transposable elements contents. The
  pattern of microsatellite distribution may differ according to the different genomic
  regions (such as coding and non-coding sequences). The observed differences in many
  important microsatellite characteristics (especially the distribution with respect
  to motif length, type and repeat number) of these angiosperm species were generally
  accordant with their phylogenetic distance, which suggested that the evolutionary
  dynamics of microsatellite distribution may be generally consistent with plant divergence/evolution.
  Importantly, by comparing these microsatellite characteristics (especially the distribution
  with respect to motif type) the angiosperm species (aside from a few species) all
  clustered into two obviously different groups that were largely represented by monocots
  and dicots, suggesting a complex and generally dichotomous evolutionary pattern
  of microsatellite distribution in angiosperms. Polyploidy may lead to a slight increase
  in microsatellite frequency in the coding sequences and a significant decrease in
  microsatellite frequency in the whole genome/non-coding sequences, but have little
  effect on the microsatellite distribution with respect to motif length, type and
  repeat number. Interestingly, several microsatellite characteristics seemed to be
  constant in plant evolution, which can be well explained by the general biological
  rules.
