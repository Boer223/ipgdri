abstract: Experiments with mycelial inoculation of detached leaves showed that lesion
  size increased with time in form of logistic curve. Lesion expansion of susceptible
  varieties was significantly faster than that of resistant ones. Analysis of conditional
  variance was first applied to genetic analysis of resistance to lesion expansion
  and the results showed that the existing variation of resistance between cultivars
  was controlled by heritable factors measured as conditional additional and conditional
  dominant variances. There was different conditional additional effects detected
  between resistance and susceptible cultivars and different conditional dominant
  effects between crosses. This analysis method is more sensitivity to detect heritability,
  for example, heritability increased by 40 percent after roots treated with oxalate
  when compared with that estimated by the normal variance analysis. It could reveal
  dynamic change of gene effects during disease development.
