	abstract = {Plants have evolved a series of strategies to combat pathogen infection. Plant SnRK1 is probably involved in shifting carbon and energy use from growth-associated processes to survival and defence upon pathogen attack, enhancing the resistance to many plant pathogens. The present study demonstrated that SnRK1.1 enhanced the resistance of Arabidopsis thaliana to clubroot disease caused by the plant-pathogenic protozoan Plasmodiophora brassicae. Through a yeast two-hybrid assay, glutathione S-transferase pull-down assay, and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assay, a P. brassicae RxLR effector, PBZF1, was shown to interact with SnRK1.1. Further expression level analysis of SnRK1.1-regulated genes showed that PBZF1 inhibited the biological function of SnRK1.1 as indicated by the disequilibration of the expression level of SnRK1.1-regulated genes in heterogeneous PBZF1-expressing A. thaliana. Moreover, heterogeneous expression of PBZF1 in A. thaliana promoted plant susceptibility to clubroot disease. In addition, PBZF1 was found to be P. brassicae-specific and conserved. This gene was significantly highly expressed in resting spores. Taken together, our results provide new insights into how the plant-pathogenic protist P. brassicae employs an effector to overcome plant resistance, and they offer new insights into the genetic improvement of plant resistance against clubroot disease.},

	abstract = {Glucosinolate (GSL) is associated with clubroot disease, which is caused by the obligate biotrophic protist Plasmodiophora brassicae. Due to the complicated composition of GSLs, their exact role in clubroot disease development remains unclear. By investigating clubroot disease resistance in cruciferous plants and characterizing the GSL content in seeds, we can determine if clubroot disease development is related to the components of GSLs. The difference in the infection process between Matthiola incana L. (resistant) and Brassica napus L. (susceptible) was determined. Root hair infection was definitely observed in both resistant and susceptible hosts, but no infection was observed during the cortical infection stage in resistant roots; this finding was verified by molecular detection of P. brassicae via PCR amplification at various times after inoculation. Based on the time course detection of the contents and compositions of GSLs after P. brassicae inoculation, susceptible roots exhibited increased accumulation of aliphatic, indolic, and aromatic GSLs in B. napus, but only aromatic GSLs were significantly increased in M. incana. Gluconapin, which was the main aliphatic GSL in B. napus and present only in B. napus, was significantly increased during the secondary infection stage. Quantification of the internal jasmonic acid (JA) concentration showed that both resistant and susceptible plants exhibited an enhanced level of JA, particularly in susceptible roots. The exogenous JA treatment induced aliphatic GSLs in B. napus and aromatic GSLs in M. incana. JA-induced aromatic GSLs may be involved in the defense against P. brassicae, whereas aliphatic GSLs induced by JA in B. napus likely play a role during the secondary infection stage. Three candidate MYB28 genes regulate the content of aliphatic GSLs identified in B. napus; one such gene was BnMYB28.1, which was significantly increased following both the treatment with exogenous JA and P. brassicae inoculation. In summary, the increased content of JA during the secondary infection stage may induce the expression of BnMYB28.1, which caused the accumulation of aliphatic GSLs in clubroot disease development.},

	abstract = {Clubroot caused by Plasmodiophora brassicae is an increasingly important soilborne disease in China. The host range of P. brassicae was investigated with 30 cruciferous plants, including 16 crop species, 9 ornamentals, and 5 weeds in field and pot-cultured conditions. In the field, 17 species from five genera produced visible galls, and these included radish, Capsella bursa-pastoris, Orychophragmus violaceus, Sinapis alba, and 13 Brassica crops. In pot-cultured conditions, an additional 13 plant species (11 genera) were determined to be hosts of P. brassicae. Five common weeds were found to be hosts of P. brassicae, including C. bursa-pastoris, Lepidium apetalum, Descurainia sophia, S. alba, and Thellungiella salsuginea. The infection of these plants was confirmed via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with primers specific to P. brassicae. No galls were found on Matthiola incana roots in the field or in pots and no resting spores of P. brassicae were observed in M. incana roots, although P. brassicae was detected in M. incana roots via PCR. Microscopic examination revealed infection only in the root hairs of M. incana roots. These results suggested that M. incana was highly resistant to P. brassicae in China and could be developed as a bait crop. In total, 297 accessions of oilseed rape were tested in the field, and 3 accessions of Brassica napus and 1 accession of B. juncea were found to be highly resistant to clubroot disease. These resistant resources provide options for managing clubroot in P. brassicae-infested fields.},

	abstract = {This study examined the role of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) during the early stage of infection of rapeseed (Brassica napus L.) by the obligate biotrophic protist Plasmodiophora brassicae Woron., which causes clubroot disease. Treatment of infected B. napus seedlings with exogenous IAA promoted the development of clubroot disease, including an increase in the number and size of galls, whereas treatment with N-1-naphthylphthalamic acid (NPA) attenuated the disease and altered the location and size of the root nodules, resulting in a reduced disease index. An increased level of free IAA was detected in the roots at 3 and 7 days after inoculation (DAI) compared with the control, suggesting the activation of IAA signaling in the early stage of P. brassicae infection. Moreover, IAA treatment caused no significant change in the germination rate of the resting spores but resulted in enhanced root hair infection. RT–PCR and quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) were used to analyze the expression of IAA homeostasis-related genes (3, 7, and 10 DAI) to identify gene expression patterns in the roots and leaves of B. napus after inoculation. Five IAA biosynthesis-related genes examined in this study were induced in the roots after inoculation with P. brassicae but not in the leaves. The rapid induction of BnAAO4 expression at 3 DAI may be responsible for the overproduction of IAA during the early stages of infection. This study suggests that IAA acts as a signaling molecule that putatively stimulates root hair infection in the early response of B. napus to P. brassicae infection.},

	abstract = {Shepherd's purse (Capsella bursa-pastoris (L.) Medicus) is an edible and wild medicinal plant widely distributed in China. This plant has been cultivated in Shanghai, China, since the end of the 19th century. Infection of C. bursa-pastoris by Plasmodiophora brassicae, the causal agent of clubroot disease on Brassica spp. has been reported in Korea (2), but is not known to occur in China. In February of 2011, stunted and wilted shepherd's purse (SP) plants were observed in a field planted to oilseed rapes (B. napus) in Sichuan Province of China. Symptomatic SP plants also exhibited root galls. Disease incidence was 6.2\% and 100\% for SP and B. napus, respectively. Root galls on diseased SP plants were collected for pathogen identification. Many resting spores were observed when the root galls were examined under a light microscope. The resting spores were circular in shape, measuring 2.0 to 3.1 μm in diameter (average 2.6 μm). PCR amplification was conducted to confirm the pathogen. DNA was extracted from root galls and healthy roots (control) of SP. Two primers, TC2F (5'-AAACAACGAGTCAGCTTGAATGCTAGTGTG-3') and TC2R (5'-CTTTAGTTGTGTTTCGGCTAGGATGGTTCG-3') were used to detect P. brassicae (1). No PCR amplifications were observed with the control DNA as template. A fragment of the expected size (approximately 520 bp) was obtained when DNA was amplified from diseased roots of SP. These results suggest that the pathogen in the galled roots of SP is P. brassicae. Pathogenicity of P. brassicae in SP was tested on plants of both SP and Chinese cabbage (CC) (B. campestris ssp. pekinensis). A resting spore suspension prepared from naturally infected SP roots was mixed with a sterilized soil in two plastic pots, resulting in a final concentration of 5 × 106 spores/g soil. Soil treated with the same volume of sterile water was used as a control. Seeds of SP and CC were pre-germinated on moist filter paper for 2 days (20°C) and seeded into the infested and control pots, one seed per pot for planted for CC and four seeds per pot for SP. The pots were placed in a chamber at 15 to 25°C under 12 h light and 12 h dark. Plants in each pot were uprooted after 4 weeks and the roots of each plant were washed under tap water and rated for clubroot disease. No disease symptoms were observed in the control treatments of SP or CC. Plants of both species showed symptoms of clubroot, with the disease incidence of 62.5\% and 100\% on SP and CC, respectively. The pathogen was isolated from diseased roots of each plant and confirmed as P. brassicae based on morphological characteristics and PCR detection. To our knowledge, this is the first report of clubroot disease on C. bursa-pastoris in Sichuan Province of China. This finding suggests that it may be necessary to manage C. bursa-pastoris in cruciferous vegetable (cabbage, turnip) and oilseed rape production fields. References: (1) T. Cao et al.

	abstract = {In plants, phloem is not only a vital structure that is used for nutrient transportation, but it is also the location of a response that defends against various stresses, named phloem-based defense (PBD). Phloem proteins (PP2s) are among the predominant proteins in phloem, indicating their potential functional role in PBD. Sclerotinia disease (SD), which is caused by the necrotrophic fungal pathogen S. sclerotiorum (Sclerotinia sclerotiorum), is a devastating disease that affects oil crops, especially Brassica napus (B. napus), mainly by blocking nutrition and water transportation through xylem and phloem. Presently, the role of PP2s in SD resistance is still largely estimated. Therefore, in this study, we identified 62 members of the PP2 gene family in the B. napus genome with an uneven distribution across the 19 chromosomes. A phylogenetic analysis classified the BnPP2s into four clusters (I-IV), with cluster I containing the most members (28 genes) as a consequence of its frequent genome segmental duplication. A comparison of the gene structures and conserved motifs suggested that BnPP2 genes were well conserved in clusters II to IV, but were variable in cluster I. Interestingly, the motifs in different clusters displayed unique features, such as motif 6 specifically existing in cluster III and motif 1 being excluded from cluster IV. These results indicated the possible functional specification of BnPP2s. A transcriptome data analysis showed that the genes in clusters II to IV exhibited dynamic expression alternation in tissues and the stimulation of S. sclerotiorum, suggesting that they could participate in SD resistance. A GWAS analysis of a rapeseed population comprising 324 accessions identified four BnPP2 genes that were potentially responsible for SD resistance and a transgenic study that was conducted by transiently expressing BnPP2-6 in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) leaves validated their positive role in regulating SD resistance in terms of reduced lesion size after inoculation with S. sclerotiorum hyphal plugs. This study provides useful information on PP2 gene functions in B. napus and could aid elaborated functional studies on the PP2 gene family.},

	abstract = {As one of the largest classes of lectins, legume lectins have a variety of desirable features such as antibacterial and insecticidal activities as well as anti-abiotic stress ability. The Sclerotinia disease (SD) caused by the soil-borne fungus Sclerotinia sclerotiorum is a devastating disease affecting most oil crops such as Brassica napus. Here, we identified 130 legume lectin (LegLu) genes in B. napus, which could be phylogenetically classified into seven clusters. The BnLegLu gene family has been significantly expanded since the whole-genome duplication (WGD) or segmental duplication. Gene structure and conserved motif analysis suggested that the BnLegLu genes were well conserved in each cluster. Moreover, relative to those genes only containing the legume lectin domain in cluster VI–VII, the genes in cluster I–V harbored a transmembrane domain and a kinase domain linked to the legume lectin domain in the C terminus. The expression of most BnLegLu genes was relatively low in various tissues. Thirty-five BnLegLu genes were responsive to abiotic stress, and 40 BnLegLu genes were strongly induced by S. sclerotiorum, with a most significant up-regulation of 715-fold, indicating their functional roles in SD resistance. Four BnLegLu genes were located in the candidate regions of genome-wide association analysis (GWAS) results which resulted from a worldwide rapeseed population consisting of 324 accessions associated with SD. Among them, the positive role of BnLegLus-16 in SD resistance was validated by transient expression in tobacco leaves. This study provides important information on BnLegLu genes, particularly about their roles in SD resistance, which may help targeted functional research and genetic improvement in the breeding of B. napus.},

The growing demand for oilseeds has necessitated the development of rapeseed varieties with improved quality. Therefore, a clear understanding of the genetic basis underlying the seed oil content (SOC) is required. In this study, a natural population comprising 204 diverse accessions and recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from Brassica napus and Sinapis alba via distant hybridization were collected for genome-wide association analysis (GWAS) and quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping of the SOC trait, respectively. The variable coefficient of the RIL and natural populations ranged from 7.43 to 10.43\% and 8.40 to 10.91\%. Then, a high-density linkage map was constructed based on whole genome re-sequencing (WGS); the map harbored 2,799 bin markers and covered a total distance of 1,835.21 cM, with an average marker interval of 0.66 cM. The QTLs for SOC on chromosome A07 were stably detected in both single and multiple environments. Finally, a novel locus qA07.SOC was identified as the major QTL for SOC based on the GWAS and RIL populations. In addition, the RNA-seq results showed that photosynthesis, lipid biosynthesis proteins, fatty acid metabolism, and unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis were significantly different between the developed seeds of the two parents of the RIL population. By comparing the variation information and expression levels of the syntenic genes within qA07.SOC and its syntenic genomic regions, as well as through haplotype analysis via GWAS, BnaA07.STR18, BnaA07.NRT1, and BnaA07g12880D were predicted as candidate genes in the qA07.SOC interval.

In each subfamily, the genes showed relatively conserved structures and motifs, but displayed distinct expression patterns in different tissues and under abiotic stress, which might be caused by the varied cis-acting regulatory elements among them. Transcriptome datasets from Pacbio/Illumina platforms showed that alternative splicing of SR genes was widespread in B. napus and the majority of paralogous gene pairs displayed different splicing patterns. Protein-protein interaction analysis indicated that SR proteins were involved in the regulation of the whole lifecycle of mRNA, from synthesis to decay. Moreover, the association mapping analysis suggested that 12 SR genes were candidate genes for regulating specific agronomic traits, which indicated that SR genes could affect the development and hence influence the important agronomic traits of B. napus.

Therefore, in this study, we performed genome-wide analysis to identify the ARI gene family and explore their potential importance in B. napus. A total of 39 ARI genes were identified in the B. napus genome and were classified into three subfamilies (A, B and C) based on phylogenetic analysis. The protein-protein interaction networks and enrichment analysis indicated that BnARI genes could be involved in endoreduplication, DNA repair, proteasome assembly, ubiquitination, protein kinase activity and stress adaptation. The transcriptome data analysis in various tissues provided us an indication of some BnARI genes' functional importance in tissue development. We also identified potential BnARI genes that were significantly responsive towards the abiotic stresses. Furthermore, eight BnARI genes were identified as candidate genes for multiple agronomic traits through association mapping analysis in B. napus; among them, BnaA02g12100D, which is the ortholog of AtARI8, was significantly associated with ten agronomic traits.

	abstract = {SET domain group encoding proteins function as histone lysine methyltransferases. These proteins are involved in various biological processes, including plant development and adaption to the environment by modifying the chromatin structures. So far, the SET domain genes (SDGs) have not been systematically investigated in Brassica napus (B. napus). In the current study, through genome-wide analysis, a total of 122 SDGs were identified in the B. napus genome. These BnSDGs were subdivided into seven (I-VII) classes based on phylogeny analysis, domain configurations, and motif distribution. Segmental duplication was involved in the evolution of this family, and the duplicated genes were under strong purifying selection. The promoter sequence of BnSDGs consisted of various growth, hormones, and stress-related cis-acting elements along with transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) for 20 TF families in 59 of the 122 BnSDGs. The gene ontology (GO) analysis revealed that BnSDGs were closely associated with histone and non-histone methylation and metal binding capacity localized mostly in the nucleus. The in silico expression analysis at four developmental stages in leaf, stem root, floral organ, silique, and seed tissues showed a broad range of tissue and stage-specific expression pattern. The expression analysis under four abiotic stresses (dehydration, cold, ABA, and salinity) also provided evidence for the importance of BnSDGs in stress environments. Based on expression analysis, we performed reverse transcription-quantitative PCR for 15 target BnSDGs in eight tissues (young leaf, mature leaf, root, stem, carpel, stamen, sepal, and petals). Our results were in accordance with the in silico expression data, suggesting the importance of these genes in plant development. In conclusion, this study lays a foundation for future functional studies on SDGs in B. napus.},

	abstract = {Cupin\_1 domain-containing proteins (CDPs) are ubiquitously present in higher plants, which are known to play essential roles in various biological processes. In this study, we carried out genome-wide characterization and systematic investigation of the CDP genes in Brassica napus. A total of 96 BnCDPs, including 71 germin-like proteins (GLPs; proteins with a single cupin\_1 domain) and 25 CDP bicupins (proteins with two cupin\_1 domains), were identified and clustered into six distinct subfamilies (I–VI) based on the phylogenic analysis, gene structure and motif distribution. Further analysis indicated that whole-genome duplication (WGD) and segmental duplication are main contributors to the species-specific expansion of the BnCDP gene family, and all the duplicated genes subsequently underwent strong purification selection. The promoter region of BnCDPs showed enrichment of cis-regulatory elements associated with development, hormone and stress, as well as transcription factor binding sites, which validates the prediction that BnCDPs are widely involved in plant growth and biotic and abiotic stress responses. The BnCDPs in different subfamilies exhibited obvious differences in expression among 30 developmental tissues/stages of B. napus, implying that BnCDPs may be involved in tissue- and stage-specific developmental processes. Similar trends in expression of most BnCDPs were observed under Sclerotinia sclerotiorum inoculation and four abiotic stresses (dehydration, cold, ABA and salinity), particularly the BnGLPs in subfamily I and III with single cupin\_1 domain, revealing that BnCDPs are of great importance in the environmental adaption of B. napus. We then performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 274 B. napus core germplasms on S. sclerotiorum resistance and identified four significantly associated loci harboring five BnGLPs. The expression levels of two candidate genes, BnGLP1.A08 and BnGLP1.C08, were significantly correlated with S. sclerotiorum resistance. Their functional responses to multiple stages of S. sclerotiorum inoculation and four abiotic stresses were further examined through qPCR. Overall, this study provides rich resources for research on the function and evolutionary playground of CDP genes.},

	abstract = {Traits related to flowering time are the most promising agronomic traits that directly impact the seed yield and oil quality of rapeseed (Brassica napus L.). Developing early flowering and maturity rapeseed varieties is an important breeding objective in B. napus. Many studies have reported on days to flowering, but few have reported on budding, bolting, and the interval between bolting and DTF. Therefore, elucidating the genetic architecture of QTLs and genes regulating flowering time, we presented an integrated investigation on SNP and haplotype-based genome-wide association study of 373 diverse B. napus germplasm, which were genotyped by the 60K SNP array and were phenotyped in the four environments. The results showed that a total of 15 and 37 QTLs were detected from SNP and haplotype-based GWAS, respectively. Among them, seven QTL clusters were identified by haplotype-based GWAS. Moreover, three and eight environmentally stable QTLs were detected by SNP-GWAS and haplotype-based GWAS, respectively. By integrating the above two approaches and by co-localizing the four traits, ten (10) genomic regions were under selection on chromosomes A03, A07, A08, A10, C06, C07, and C08. Interestingly, the genomic regions FT.A07.1, FT.A08, FT.C06, and FT.C07 were identified as novel. In these ten regions, a total of 197 genes controlling FT were detected, of which 14 highly expressed DEGs were orthologous to 13 Arabidopsis thaliana genes after integration with transcriptome results. In a nutshell, the above results uncovered the genetic architecture of important agronomic traits related to flowering time and provided a basis for multiple molecular marker-trait associations in B. napus.},

	abstract = {Plant height is a crucial element related to plant architecture that influences the seed yield of oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.). In this study, we isolated a natural B. napus mutant, namely a semi-dwarf mutant (sdw-e), which exhibits a 30\% reduction in plant height compared to Zhongshuang 11-HP (ZS11-HP). Quantitative trait locus sequencing (QTL-seq) was conducted using two extreme DNA bulks in F2 populations in Wuchang-2017 derived from ZS11-HP × sdw-e to identify QTLs associated with plant height. The result suggested that two QTL intervals were located on chromosome A10. The F2 population consisting of 200 individuals in Yangluo-2018 derived from ZS11-HP × sdw-e was used to construct a high-density linkage map using whole-genome resequencing. The high-density linkage map harbored 4323 bin markers and covered a total distance of 2026.52 cM with an average marker interval of 0.47 cM. The major QTL for plant height named qPHA10 was identified on linkage group A10 by interval mapping (IM) and composite interval mapping (CIM) methods. The major QTL qPHA10 was highly consistent with the QTL-seq results. And then, we integrated the variation sites and expression levels of genes in the major QTL interval to predict the candidate genes. Thus, the identified QTL and candidate genes could be used in marker-assisted selection for B. napus breeding in the future.},

We mapped yvl locus to a 70-kb interval between molecular markers yvl-O10 and InDel-O6 on chromosome A03 in BC2F2 population using whole genome re-sequencing and bulked segregant analysis. The mutant had a 'C' to 'T' substitution in the coding sequence of BnaA03.CHLH, which encodes putative H subunit of Mg-protoporphyrin IX chelatase (CHLH). The mutation resulted in an imperfect protein structure and reduced activity of CHLH. It also hampered the plastid encoded RNA polymerase which transcribes regulatory genes of photosystem II and I. Consequently, the chlorophyll a/b and carotenoid contents were reduced and the chloroplast ultrastructure was degraded in yvl mutant. These results explain that a single nucleotide mutation in BnaA03.CHLH impairs PEP activity to disrupt chloroplast development and chlorophyll biosynthesis in B. napus.},

	abstract = {Tung tree (Vernicia fordii) is an economically important woody oil plant that produces tung oil rich in eleostearic acid. Here, we report a high-quality chromosome-scale genome sequence of tung tree. The genome sequence was assembled by combining Illumina short reads, Pacific Biosciences single-molecule real-time long reads, and Hi-C sequencing data. The size of tung tree genome is 1.12 Gb, with 28,422 predicted genes and over 73\% repeat sequences. The V. fordii underwent an ancient genome triplication event shared by core eudicots but no further whole-genome duplication in the subsequent ca. 34.55 million years of evolutionary history of the tung tree lineage. Insertion time analysis revealed that repeat-driven genome expansion might have arisen as a result of long-standing long terminal repeat retrotransposon bursts and lack of efficient DNA deletion mechanisms. The genome harbors 88 resistance genes encoding nucleotide-binding sites; 17 of these genes may be involved in early-infection stage of Fusarium wilt resistance. Further, 651 oil-related genes were identified, 88 of which are predicted to be directly involved in tung oil biosynthesis. Relatively few phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase genes, and synergistic effects between transcription factors and oil biosynthesis-related genes might contribute to the high oil content of tung seed. The tung tree genome constitutes a valuable resource for understanding genome evolution, as well as for molecular breeding and genetic improvements for oil production.},

The relationship between Microcystis and the associated bacteria was investigated by a metagenomic approach in this study. We developed a visualization-guided method of binning for genome assembly after total colony DNA sequencing. We found that the method was effective in grouping sequences and it did not require reference genome sequence. Individual genomes of the colony bacteria were obtained and they provided valuable insights into microbial community structures. Analysis of metabolic pathways based on these genomes revealed that while all heterotrophic bacteria were dependent upon Microcystis for carbon and energy, Vitamin B12 biosynthesis, which is required for growth by Microcystis, was accomplished in a cooperative fashion among the bacteria. Our analysis also suggests that individual bacteria in the colony community contributed a complete pathway for degradation of benzoate, which is inhibitory to the cyanobacterial growth, and its ecological implication for Microcystis bloom is discussed.},

Although yellowish flower color is a common variant observed in field-grown oilseed rape, the genetics behind this variation remains unclear. We obtained a yellowish-white flower (ywf) mutant from Zhongshuang 9 (ZS9) by ethyl methanesulfonate mutagenesis (EMS) treatment. Compared with ZS9, ywf exhibited a lower carotenoid content with a reduced and defective chromoplast ultrastructure in the petals. Genetic analysis revealed that the yellowish-white trait was controlled by a single recessive gene. Using bulked-segregant analysis sequencing (BSA-seq) and kompetitive allele-specific PCR (KASP), we performed map-based cloning of the ywf locus on chromosome A08 and found that ywf harbored a C-to-T substitution in the coding region, resulting in a premature translation termination. YWF, encoding phytoene desaturase 3 (PDS3), was highly expressed in oilseed rape petals and involved in carotenoid biosynthesis. Pathway enrichment analysis of the transcriptome profiles from ZS9 and ywf indicated the carotenoid biosynthesis pathway to be highly enriched. Further analyses of differentially expressed genes and carotenoid components revealed that the truncated BnaA08.PDS3 resulted in decreased carotenoid biosynthesis in the mutant. These results contribute to an understanding of the carotenoid biosynthesis pathway and manipulation of flower-color variation in B. napus.},

However, molecular and cellular mechanisms regulating the assembly and rearrangement of actin filaments (AFs) at plant-pathogen interaction sites remain largely elusive. Here, using live-cell imaging, we show that one of the earliest cellular responses in Arabidopsis thaliana upon powdery mildew attack is the formation of patch-like AF structures beneath fungal invasion sites. The AFs constituting actin patches undergo rapid turnover, which is regulated by the actin-related protein (ARP)2/3 complex and its activator, the WAVE/SCAR regulatory complex (W/SRC). The focal accumulation of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate at fungal penetration sites appears to be a crucial upstream modulator of the W/SRC-ARP2/3 pathway-mediated actin patch formation. Knockout of W/SRC-ARP2/3 pathway subunits partially compromised penetration resistance with impaired endocytic recycling of the defense-associated t-SNARE protein PEN1 and its deposition into apoplastic papillae. Simultaneously knocking out ARP3 and knocking down the Class I formin (AtFH1) abolished actin patch formation, severely impaired the deposition of cell wall appositions, and promoted powdery mildew entry into host cells. Our results demonstrate that the ARP2/3 complex and formins, two actin-nucleating systems, act cooperatively and contribute to Arabidopsis penetration resistance to fungal invasion.},

Due to its intracellular obligate biotrophic nature, the life cycle of P. brassicae is still not fully understood. Here, we used fluorescent probe-based confocal microscopy and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to investigate the infection process of P. brassicae on the susceptible host Arabidopsis under controlled conditions. We found that P. brassicae can initiate the primary infection in both root hairs and epidermal cells, producing the uninucleate primary plasmodium at 1 day postinoculation (dpi). After that, the developed multinucleate primary plasmodium underwent condensing and cytoplasm cleavage into uninucleate zoosporangia from 1 to 4 dpi. This was subsequently followed by the formation of multinucleate zoosporangia and the production of secondary zoospores within zoosporangium. Importantly, the secondary zoospores performed a conjugation in the root epidermal cells after their release. TEM revealed extensive uninucleate secondary plasmodium in cortical cells at 8 dpi, indicating the establishment of the secondary infection. The P. brassicae subsequently developed into binucleate, quadrinucleate, and multinucleate secondary plasmodia from 10 to 15 dpi, during which the clubroot symptoms appeared. The uninucleate resting spores were first observed in the cortical cells at 24 dpi, marking the completion of a life cycle. We also provided evidence that the secondary infection of P. brassicae may represent the diploid sexual life stage. From these findings, we propose a refined life cycle of P. brassicae which will contribute to understanding of the complicated infection biology of P. brassicae.},

SsReV1 has a genome of 28 055 bp and is composed of 11 double-stranded RNA segments. With a combination of unique molecular features, virion shape and composition, and phylogenetic analysis, SsReV1 is significantly distinct from all known reoviruses and defines a novel genus in the family Reoviridae. Interestingly, two conserved domains, double-stranded RNA binding motif (dsRBM, Pfam 00 035) and reovirus sigma C capsid protein (Reo\_σC, pfam04 582), were identified in the genome of SsReV1, which are widespread in diverse virus lineages. Sequence comparison and phylogenetic analysis revealed that multiple cross-family horizontal gene transfer (HGT) events could occur between reoviruses and double-stranded DNA viruses, single-stranded RNA viruses and even cellular organisms. Interestingly, the dsRBM of SsReV1 was phylogenetically related to dsRNA-binding proteins of some insects, but not reoviruses. These results indicated that SsReV1 is a new taxonomic representative in Reoviridae, which provides new insights into the diversity and global ecology of reoviruses and other segmented double-stranded RNA viruses. More importantly, the present results provided evidence indicating that reoviruses indeed have HGT events with other virus lineages on a large scale and that HGT may serve as an important driving factor that plays a key role in the evolution of reoviruses.},

In this study, we report a novel mycovirus S. sclerotiorum botybirnavirus 1 (SsBRV1) that was originally isolated from the hypovirulent strain SCH941 of S. sclerotiorum. SsBRV1 has rigid spherical virions that are ∼38 nm in diameter, and three double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) segments (dsRNA1, 2, and 3 with lengths of 6.4, 6.0, and 1.7 kbp, respectively) were packaged in the virions. dsRNA1 encodes a cap-pol fusion protein, and dsRNA2 encodes a polyprotein with unknown functions but contributes to the formation of virus particles. The dsRNA3 is dispensable and may be a satellite-like RNA of SsBRV1. Although phylogenetic analysis of the RdRp domain demonstrated that SsBRV1 is related to Botrytis porri RNA virus 1 (BpRV1) and Ustilago maydis dsRNA virus-H1, the structure proteins of SsBRV1 do not have any significant sequence similarities with other known viral proteins with the exception of those of BpRV1. SsBRV1 carrying dsRNA3 seems to have no obvious effects on the colony morphology, but can significantly reduce the growth rate and virulence of S. sclerotiorum. These findings provide new insights into the virus taxonomy, virus evolution and the interactions between SsBRV1 and the fungal hosts.},

To understand the mechanism of cytoplasmic male sterility in cotton (Gossypium hirsutum), transcriptomic, cytological, and biochemical analysis were performed between the cytoplasmic male sterility CMS-D8 line, Zhong41A, and its maintainer line Zhong41B. A total of 2335 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in the CMS line at three different stages of anther development. Bioinformatics analysis of these DEGs indicated their relationship to reactive oxygen species (ROS) homeostasis, including reduction-oxidation reactions and the metabolism of glutathione and ascorbate. At the same time, DEGs associated with tapetum development, especially the transition to secretory tapetum, were down-regulated in the CMS line. Biochemical analysis indicated that the ability of the CMS line to eliminate ROS was decreased, which led to the rapid release of H2O2. Cytological analysis revealed that the most crucial defect in the CMS line was the abnormal tapetum. All these results are consistent with the RNA sequencing data. On the basis of our findings, we propose that ROS act as signal molecules, which are released from mitochondria and transferred to the nucleus, triggering the formation of abnormal tapetum.},

To identify genetic factors contributing to Cd uptake in wheat, we conducted a genome-wide association study with genotyping from 90K SNP array. A spring wheat diversity panel was planted under normal conditions and Cd stress (50 mg Cd/kg soil). The impact of Cd stress on agronomic traits ranged from a reduction of 16\% in plant height to 93\% in grain iron content. Individual genotypes showed a considerable variation for Cd uptake and translocation subdividing the panel into three groups: (1) hyper-accumulators (i.e. high Leaf\_Cd and low Seed\_Cd ), (2) hyper-translocators (i.e. low Leaf\_Cd and high Seed\_Cd ), and (3) moderate lines (i.e. low Leaf\_Cd and low Seed\_Cd ). Two lines (SKD-1 and TD-1) maintained an optimum grain yield under Cd stress and were therefore considered as Cd resistant lines. Genome-wide association identified 179 SNP-trait associations for various traits including 16 for Cd uptake at a significance level of P {\textless} .001. However, only five SNPs were significant after applying multiple testing correction. These loci were associated with seed-cadmium, grain-iron, and grain-zinc: qSCd-1A, qSCd-1D, qZn-2B1, qZn-2B2, and qFe-6D. These five loci had not been identified in the previously reported studies for Cd uptake in wheat. These loci and the underlying genes should be further investigated using molecular biology techniques to identify Cd resistant genes in wheat.},

Brown planthopper (BPH) is the most severe insect of rice, and the biotypes adapt to feed on different rice genotypes. Here, we present genomics analyses on 1,520 global rice germplasms for resistance to three BPH biotypes. Genome-wide association studies identified 3,502 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 59 loci associated with BPH resistance in rice. We cloned a previously unidentified gene Bph37 that confers resistance to BPH. The associated loci showed high nucleotide diversity. Genome-wide scans for trans-species polymorphisms revealed ancient balancing selection at the loci. The secondarily evolved insect biotypes II and III exhibited significantly higher virulence and overcame more rice varieties than the primary biotype I. In response, more SNPs and loci evolved in rice for resistance to biotypes II and III. Notably, three exceptional large regions with high SNP density and resistance-associated loci on chromosomes 4 and 6 appear distinct between the resistant and susceptible rice varieties. Surprisingly, these regions in resistant rice might have been retained from wild species Oryza nivara. Our findings expand the understanding of long-term interactions between rice and BPH and provide resistance genes and germplasm resources for breeding durable BPH-resistant rice varieties.},

	abstract = {Multi-functional microRNAs (miRNAs) are emerging as key modulators of plant-pathogen interactions. Although the involvement of some miRNAs in plant-insect interactions has been revealed, the underlying mechanisms are still elusive. The brown planthopper (BPH) is the most notorious rice (Oryza sativa)-specific insect that causes severe yield losses each year and requires urgent biological control. To reveal the miRNAs involved in rice-BPH interactions, we performed miRNA sequencing and identified BPH-responsive OsmiR396. Sequestering OsmiR396 by overexpressing target mimicry (MIM396) in three genetic backgrounds indicated that OsmiR396 negatively regulated BPH resistance. Overexpression of one BPH-responsive target gene of OsmiR396, growth regulating factor 8 (OsGRF8), showed resistance to BPH. Furthermore, the flavonoid contents increased in both the OsmiR396-sequestered and the OsGRF8 overexpressing plants. By analysing 39 natural rice varieties, the elevated flavonoid contents were found to correlate with enhanced BPH resistance. Artificial applications of flavonoids to wild type (WT) plants also increased resistance to BPH. A BPH-responsive flavanone 3-hydroxylase (OsF3H) gene in the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway was proved to be directly regulated by OsGRF8. A genetic functional analysis of OsF3H revealed its positive role in mediating both the flavonoid contents and BPH resistance. And analysis of the genetic correlation between OsmiR396 and OsF3H showed that down-regulation of OsF3H complemented the BPH resistance characteristic and simultaneously decreased the flavonoid contents of the MIM396 plants. Thus, we revealed a new BPH resistance mechanism mediated by the OsmiR396-OsGRF8-OsF3H-flavonoid pathway. Our study suggests potential applications of miRNAs in BPH resistance breeding.},

	abstract = {Phloem-feeding insects cause massive losses in agriculture and horticulture. Host plant resistance to phloem-feeding insects is often mediated by changes in phloem composition, which deter insect settling and feeding and decrease viability. Here, we report that rice plant resistance to the phloem-feeding brown planthopper (BPH) is associated with fortification of the sclerenchyma tissue, which is located just beneath the epidermis and a cell layer or two away from the vascular bundle in the rice leaf sheath. We found that BPHs prefer to feed on the smooth and soft region on the surface of rice leaf sheaths called the long-cell block. We identified Bph30 as a rice BPH resistance gene that prevents BPH stylets from reaching the phloem due to the fortified sclerenchyma. Bph30 is strongly expressed in sclerenchyma cells and enhances cellulose and hemicellulose synthesis, making the cell walls stiffer and sclerenchyma thicker. The structurally fortified sclerenchyma is a formidable barrier preventing BPH stylets from penetrating the leaf sheath tissues and arriving at the phloem to feed. Bph30 belongs to a novel gene family, encoding a protein with two leucine-rich domains. Another member of the family, Bph40, also conferred resistance to BPH. Collectively, the fortified sclerenchyma-mediated resistance mechanism revealed in this study expands our understanding of plant-insect interactions and opens a new path for controlling planthoppers in rice.},

Here, we further explored the function of EXO70 members in rice resistance against planthoppers. We used the yeast two-hybrid and co-immunoprecipitation assays to identify proteins that play roles in Bph6-mediated planthopper resistance. The functions of the identified proteins were characterized via gene transformation, plant resistance evaluation, insect performance, cell excretion observation and cell wall component analyses. We discovered that another EXO70 member, OsEXO70H3, interacted with BPH6 and functioned in cell excretion and in Bph6-mediated planthopper resistance. We further found that OsEXO70H3 interacted with an S-adenosylmethionine synthetase-like protein (SAMSL) and increased the delivery of SAMSL outside the cells. The functional impairment of OsEXO70H3 and SAMSL reduced the lignin content and the planthopper resistance level of rice plants. Our results suggest that OsEXO70H3 may recruit SAMSL and help its excretion to the apoplast where it may be involved in lignin deposition in cell walls, thus contributing to rice resistance to planthoppers.},

Transcriptome analysis has revealed a large number of defense-related genes and response processes. However, the similarities and differences in the defense responses of different tissues are rarely reported. In this study, we analyzed the similarities and differences of different tissues in response to S. sclerotiorum at 24 h post inoculation (hpi) by using the published transcriptome data for respective leaf and stem inoculation. At 24 hpi, large differences in gene expression exist in leaf and stem, and there are more differentially expressed genes and larger expression differences in leaf. The leaf is more sensitive to S. sclerotiorum and shows a stronger response than stem. Different defense responses appear in the leaf and stem, and the biosynthesis of lignin, callose, lectin, chitinase, PGIP, and PR protein is activated in leaf. In the stem, lipid metabolism-mediated defense responses are obviously enhanced. For the common defense responses in both leaf and stem, the chain reactions resulting from signal transduction and biological process take the primary responsibility. This research will be beneficial to exploit the potential of different tissues in plant defense and find higher resistance levels of genotypic variability in different environments.

As a competitive inhibitor of SAM-dependent methylation, the effect of S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) on lignin biosynthesis, however, is still largely unknown in plants. Expression levels of Cystathionine γ-synthase (PvCGS) and S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase 1 (PvSAHH1) were down-regulated by RNAi technology, respectively, in switchgrass, a dual-purpose forage and biofuel crop. The transgenic switchgrass lines were subjected to studying the impact of SAH on lignin biosynthesis. Our results showed that down-regulation of PvCGS in switchgrass altered the accumulation of aspartate-derived and aromatic amino acids, reduced the content of SAH, enhanced lignin biosynthesis and stunted plant growth. In contrast, down-regulation of PvSAHH1 raised SAH levels in switchgrass, impaired the biosynthesis of both guaiacyl and syringyl lignins and therefore significantly increased saccharification efficiency of cell walls. This work indicates that SAH plays a crucial role in monolignol methylation in switchgrass. Genetic regulation of either PvCGS or PvSAHH1 expression in switchgrass can change intracellular SAH contents and SAM to SAH ratios and therefore affect lignin biosynthesis. Thus, our study suggests that genes involved in Met metabolism are of interest as new valuable targets for cell wall bioengineering in future.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Copy number variation (CNV), a complex genomic rearrangement, has been extensively studied in humans and other organisms. In plants, CNVs of several genes were found to be responsible for various important traits; however, the cause and consequence of CNVs remains largely unknown. Recently released next-generation sequencing (NGS) data provide an opportunity for a genome-wide study of CNVs in rice.
RESULTS: Here, by an NGS-based approach, we generated a CNV map comprising 9,196 deletions compared to the reference genome 'Nipponbare'. Using Oryza glaberrima as the outgroup, 80\% of the CNV events turned out to be insertions in Nipponbare. There were 2,806 annotated genes affected by these CNV events. We experimentally validated 28 functional CNV genes including OsMADS56, BPH14, OsDCL2b and OsMADS30, implying that CNVs might have contributed to phenotypic variations in rice. Most CNV genes were found to be located in non-co-linear positions by comparison to O. glaberrima. One of the origins of these non-co-linear genes was genomic duplications caused by transposon activity or double-strand break repair. Comprehensive analysis of mutation mechanisms suggested an abundance of CNVs formed by non-homologous end-joining and mobile element insertion.
CONCLUSIONS: This study showed the impact and origin of copy number variations in rice on a genomic scale.},

Medicago truncatula is an ideal model plant for genetic research in legumes, and specifically for studying nodulation, which is crucial for nitrogen fixation. In this study, 59 MtGRAS genes were identified and classified into eight distinct subgroups based on phylogenetic relationships. Motifs located in the C-termini were conserved across the subgroups, while motifs in the N-termini were subfamily specific. Gene duplication was the main evolutionary force for MtGRAS expansion, especially proliferation of the LISCL subgroup. Seventeen duplicated genes showed strong effects of purifying selection and diverse expression patterns, highlighting their functional importance and diversification after duplication. Thirty MtGRAS genes, including NSP1 and NSP2, were preferentially expressed in nodules, indicating possible roles in the process of nodulation. A transcriptome study, combined with gene expression analysis under different stress conditions, suggested potential functions of MtGRAS genes in various biological pathways and stress responses. Taken together, these comprehensive analyses provide basic information for understanding the potential functions of GRAS genes, and will facilitate further discovery of MtGRAS gene functions.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Maize brown midrib (bm) mutants associated with impaired lignin biosynthesis are a potential source for the breed of novel germplasms with improved cell wall digestibility. The spontaneous bm5 mutants had been identified since 2008. However, the gene responsible for the bm5 locus, and the comprehensive effects of bm5 mutation on lignin biosynthesis, soluble phenolics accumulation, and cell wall degradation have yet to be elucidated.
RESULTS: The bm5 locus was identified to encode a major 4-coumarate: coenzyme A ligase (Zm4CL1) through analyzing MutMap-assisted gene mapping data. Two alleles of Zm4CL1 isolated from bm5 mutants contained two transposons inserted in the first exon and the second intron, respectively, and consequently, the activities of 4CLs in the crude enzyme extracts from bm5 midribs were reduced by 51-62\% compared with the wild type. Furthermore, five 4CLs were retrieved from maize genome, and Zm4CL1 was the most highly expressed one in the lignified tissues. Mutation of Zm4CL1 mainly impeded the biosynthesis of guaiacyl (G) lignins and increased the level of soluble feruloyl derivatives without impacting maize growth and development. Moreover, both neutral detergent fiber digestibility and saccharification efficiency of cell walls were significantly elevated in the bm5 mutant.
CONCLUSIONS: Zm4CL1 was identified as the Bm5 gene, since two independent alleles of Zm4CL1 were associated with the same mutant phenotype. Mutation of Zm4CL1 mainly affected G lignin biosynthesis and soluble feruloyl derivatives accumulation in maize lignified tissues. The reduced recalcitrance of the bm5 mutant suggests that Zm4CL1 is an elite target for cell wall engineering, and genetic manipulation of this gene will facilitate the utilization of crop straw and stover that have to be dealt with for environmental protection.},

	abstract = {Plant CCCH proteins participate in the control of multiple developmental and adaptive processes, but the regulatory mechanisms underlying these processes are not well known. In this study, we showed that the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) CCCH protein C3H15 negatively regulates cell elongation by inhibiting brassinosteroid (BR) signaling. Genetic and biochemical evidence showed that C3H15 functions downstream of the receptor BR INSENSITIVE 1 (BRI1) as a negative regulator in the BR pathway. C3H15 is phosphorylated by the GLYCOGEN SYNTHASE KINASE 3 -like kinase BR-INSENSITIVE 2 (BIN2) at Ser111 in the cytoplasm in the absence of BRs. Upon BR perception, C3H15 transcription is enhanced, and the phosphorylation of C3H15 by BIN2 is reduced. The dephosphorylated C3H15 protein accumulates in the nucleus, where C3H15 regulates transcription via G-rich elements (typically GGGAGA). C3H15 and BRASSINAZOLE RESISTANT 1 (BZR1)/BRI1-EMS-SUPPRESSOR 1 (BES1), two central transcriptional regulators of BR signaling, directly suppress each other and share a number of BR-responsive target genes. Moreover, C3H15 antagonizes BZR1 and BES1 to regulate the expression of their shared cell elongation-associated target gene, SMALL AUXIN-UP RNA 15 (SAUR15). This study demonstrates that C3H15-mediated BR signaling may be parallel to, or even attenuate, the dominant BZR1 and BES1 signaling pathways to control cell elongation. This finding expands our understanding of the regulatory mechanisms underlying BR-induced cell elongation in plants.},

Each haustorium is enveloped by an extrahaustorial membrane (EHM) derived from the host plasma membrane. Little is known about the EHM biogenesis and identity. Here, we demonstrate that among the two plasma membrane phosphoinositides in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), PI(4,5)P2 is dynamically up-regulated at powdery mildew infection sites and recruited to the EHM, whereas PI4P is absent in the EHM. Lateral transport of PI(4,5)P2 into the EHM occurs through a brefeldin A-insensitive but actin-dependent trafficking pathway. Furthermore, the lower levels of PI(4,5)P2 in pip5k1 pip5k2 mutants inhibit fungal pathogen development and cause disease resistance, independent of cell death-associated defenses and involving impaired host susceptibility. Our results reveal that plant biotrophic and hemibiotrophic pathogens modulate the subcellular distribution of host phosphoinositides and recruit PI(4,5)P2 as a susceptibility factor for plant disease.},

Previously, we constructed a T-DNA insertional library, and screened for many conidiation-deficient mutants from this library. Here, we report a T-DNA insertional mutant ZS-1T21882 that completely lost conidiation. In mutant ZS-1T21882, the T-DNA was integrated into a gene (CmPrat-1) which encodes phosphoribosylamidotransferase (PRAT, EC 2.4.2.14), an enzyme catalyzing the first committed step in de novo purine nucleotide synthesis. Gene replacement and complementation experiments confirmed that phosphoribosylamidotransferase is essential for conidiation of C. minitans. Mutant ZS-1T21882 did not grow on modified Czapek-Dox broth (MCD), but it grew well on MCD amended with IMP or AMP. The conidial production of this mutant was dependent on the dosage of IMP amended. At low concentrations, such as 0.1 mM and 0.25 mM, the mutant produced very few pycnidia, while up to 0.75 mM or higher, the conidiation of this mutant was restored completely. cAMP could not restore the conidiation of mutant ZS-1T21882 when amended into MCD, but could when amended into PDA. Neither GMP nor cGMP could restore the conidiation in MCD or in PDA. Our findings suggest that phosphoribosylamidotransferase is essential for conidiation of C. minitans via adenosine related molecules. Furthermore, when dual cultured with its host, this mutant produced conidia in the host mycelium and on the sclerotia of S. sclerotiorum, but not in dead mycelium or on dead sclerotia, suggesting that C. minitans is likely to able to obtain adenosine or related components from its host during parasitization.},

Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis can provide a more rapid and accurate assessment of petal infestation levels. Primers and a hydrolysis probe were designed to amplify a 70-bp region of an S. sclerotiorum-specific gene, SS1G\_00263. A hydrolysis probe-based qPCR assay was developed that had a detection limit of 8.0 × 10-4 ng of S. sclerotiorum DNA and only amplified S. sclerotiorum DNA. Evaluation of petals collected at five sampling points in each of 10 commercial canola fields on each of two sampling dates (corresponding to 20 to 30\% bloom and 40 to 50\% bloom) revealed S. sclerotiorum DNA infestation levels of 0 to 3.3 × 10-1 ng/petal. This qPCR assay can be used to reliably quantify petal infestation and, with further research, has the potential to serve as the basis for a Sclerotinia stem rot risk assessment tool or as a means to study Sclerotinia stem rot epidemiology.},

Clubroot resistance assay on European clubroot differentials (ECD) set revealed that ECD10 (Brassica napus) and ECD4 (Brassica rapa) show a complete resistance to the tested P. brassicae isolate in contrast to highly susceptible hosts Westar (B. napus) and ECD5 (B. rapa). Previously, we used fluorescent probe-based confocal microscopy (FCM) to refine the life cycle of P. brassicae and indicate the important time points during its infection in Arabidopsis. Here, we used FCM to systematically investigate the infection of P. brassicae in two resistant host species ECD10 and ECD4 and two non-host crops wheat and barley at each indicated time points, compared with two susceptible hosts Westar and ECD5. We found that P. brassicae can initiate the primary infection phase and produce uninucleate primary plasmodia in both resistant hosts and non-hosts just like susceptible hosts at 2 days post-inoculation (dpi). Importantly, P. brassicae can develop into zoosporangia and secondary zoospores and release the secondary zoospores from the zoosporangia in resistant hosts at 7 dpi, comparable to susceptible hosts. However, during the secondary infection phase, no secondary plasmodium was detected in the cortical cells of both resistant hosts in contrast to massive secondary plasmodia present in the cortex tissue of two susceptible hosts leading to root swelling at 15 dpi. In both non-host crops, only uninucleate primary plasmodia were observed throughout roots at 7 and 15 dpi. Quantitative PCR based on DNA revealed that the biomass of P. brassicae has no significant increase from 2 dpi in non-host plants and from 7 dpi in resistant host plants, compared to the huge biomass increase in susceptible host plants from 2 to 25 dpi. Our study reveals that the primary infection phase in the root epidermis and the secondary infection phase in the cortex tissue are, respectively, blocked in non-hosts and resistant hosts, contributing to understanding of cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying clubroot non-host and host resistance.},

	abstract = {Rice blast disease caused by Magnaporthe oryzae is initiated by the attachment of conidia to plant surfaces. Germ tubes emerging from conidia develop melanized appressoria to physically penetrate the host surface. Previous studies revealed that appressorium development requires the breakdown of storage lipids and glycogen that occur in peroxisomes and the cytosol respectively, culminating in production of pyruvate. However, the downstream product(s) entering the mitochondria for further oxidation is unclear. In this study, we aimed to investigate the molecular basis underlying the metabolic flux towards the mitochondria associated with the infectious-related development in M. oryzae. We showed that D-lactate is a key intermediate metabolite of the mobilization of lipids and glycogen, and its oxidative conversion to pyruvate is catalysed by a mitochondrial D-lactate dehydrogenase MoDLD1. Deletion of MoDLD1 caused defects in conidiogenesis and appressorium formation, and subsequently the loss of fungal pathogenicity. Further analyses demonstrated that MoDLD1 activity is involved in the maintenance of redox homeostasis during conidial germination. Thus, MoDLD1 is a critical modulator that channels metabolite flow to the mitochondrion coupling cellular redox state, and contributes to development and virulence of M. oryzae.},

	abstract = {The rapid reorganization and polarization of actin filaments (AFs) toward the pathogen penetration site is one of the earliest cellular responses, yet the regulatory mechanism of AF dynamics is poorly understood. Using live-cell imaging in Arabidopsis, we show that polarization coupled with AF bundling involves precise spatiotemporal control at the site of attempted penetration by the nonadapted barley powdery mildew fungus, Blumeria graminis f. sp. hordei (Bgh). We further show that the Bgh-triggered AF mobility and organelle aggregation are predominately driven by the myosin motor proteins. Inactivation of myosins by pharmacological inhibitors prevents bulk aggregation of organelles and blocks recruitment of lignin-like compounds to the penetration site and deposition of callose and defensive protein, PENETRATION 1 (PEN1) into the apoplastic papillae, resulting in attenuation of penetration resistance. Using gene knockout analysis, we demonstrate that highly expressed myosins XI, especially myosin XI-K, are the primary contributors to cell wall-mediated penetration resistance. Moreover, the quadruple myosin knockout mutant xi-1 xi-2 xi-i xi-k displays impaired trafficking pathway responsible for the accumulation of PEN1 at the cell periphery. Strikingly, this mutant shows not only increased penetration rate but also enhanced overall disease susceptibility to both adapted and nonadapted fungal pathogens. Our findings establish myosins XI as key regulators of plant antifungal immunity.},

This comprehensive dataset for seed development in tetraploid and ancestral diploid Brassicas provides new insights into evolutionary divergence and expression bias at the gene and subgenome levels during the domestication of these valued crop species. Comparisons of gene expression associated with regulatory networks and metabolic pathways operating in the embryo and seed coat during seed development reveal differences in storage reserve accumulation and fatty acid metabolism among the six Brassica species.

However, the evolution of AS and its influence on grain development in diploid grass and valuable polyploid wheat crops are poorly understood. To address this knowledge gap, we developed a pipeline for the analysis of alternatively spliced transcript isoforms, which takes the high sequence similarity among polyploid wheat subgenomes into account. Through analysis of synteny and detection of collinearity of homoeologous subgenomes, conserved and specific AS events across five wheat and grass species were identified. A global analysis of the regulation of AS in diploid grass and polyploid wheat grains revealed diversity in AS events not only between the endosperm, pericarp and embryo overdevelopment, but also between subgenomes. Analysis of AS in homoeologous triads of polyploid wheats revealed evolutionary divergence between gene-level and transcript-level regulation of embryogenesis. Evolutionary age analysis indicated that the generation of novel transcript isoforms has occurred in young genes at a more rapid rate than in ancient genes. These findings, together with the development of comprehensive AS resources for wheat and grass species, advance understanding of the evolution of regulatory features of AS during embryogenesis and grain development in wheat.},

Further, while K48-linked polyubiquitin chain is important for protein degradation, much less is known about the functions of other types of polyubiquitin chains in plants. We showed previously that UBC22 is unique in its ability to catalyze K11-dependent Ub dimer formation in vitro and ubc22 knockout mutants had defects in megasporogenesis. In this study, further analyses of the Arabidopsis ubc22 mutants revealed four subtypes of plants based on the phenotypic changes in vegetative growth. These four subtypes appeared consistently in the plants of three independent ubc22 mutants. Transcriptomic analysis showed that transcript levels of genes related to several pathways were altered differently in different subtypes of mutant plants. In one subtype, the mutant plants had increased expression of genes related to plant defenses and showed enhanced resistance to a necrotrophic plant pathogen. These results suggest multiple functions of UBC22 during plant development and stress response.},

It is generally accepted that fungicides will bring significant negative side-effects to the environment and result in fungicide resistance in the pathogenic fungi. Although previous research has focused on fungicide application rates and fungal resistance for a long time, little attention has been paid to fungicide residues after treatment, especially their potential role in fungal growth and sporulation. Here we investigated the effect of fungicides at sublethal concentrations on fungal sporulation. The results showed that two kinds of 14α-demethylase inhibitors (DMIs) fungicides increased the number of isolates of Colletotrichum spp. to sporulate on PDA. Both on PDA medium and plant tissue, low concentration of DMI fungicides could promote spore production of Colletotrichum spp., whereas pyraclostrobin, a quinone outside inhibitor (QoIs), had no significant effects on sporulation of Colletotrichum spp. Transcriptomic analysis suggested that the DMIs fungicide stress signal may be transmitted to the central regulatory pathway through the FluG-mediated signalling pathway, and further confirmed the morphological effect of DMI fungicide on promoting sporulation of Colletotrichum. To our knowledge, this is the first study to provide insights into the reproductive response of fungi in response to fungicide stress. Our findings indicate that fungicides have two-way effects on the growth and reproduction of pathogenic fungi and provide a new basis for the scientific and rational use of fungicides.},

Water loss was profiled in a pure pectin system and in vivo. While calcium and boron reduced water loss in pure pectin standards, the impact on Allium species was insignificant (p {\textgreater} 0.05). Nevertheless, synchrotron X-ray microscopy showed the localization of exogenously applied calcium to the apoplast in the epidermal cells of Allium fistulosum. Exogenous calcium application increased viscosity and resistance to shear force in Allium fistulosum, suggesting the formation of calcium cross-linkages ("egg-box" structures). Moreover, Allium fistulosum (freezing tolerant) was also more tolerant to dehydration stress compared to Allium cepa (freezing sensitive). Furthermore, the addition of boric acid (H3BO3) to pure pectin reduced water loss and increased viscosity, which indicates the formation of RG-II dimers. The Arabidopsis boron transport mutant, bor1, expressed greater water loss and, based on the lesion area of leaf tissue, a greater susceptibility to Colletotrichum higginsianum and Botrytis cinerea. While pectin modifications in the cell wall are likely not the sole solution to dehydration and biotic stress resistance, they appear to play an important role against multiple stresses.},

In this study, we use metabolomics and growth measurements to map QTL in rice, a major staple crop. Previous rice metabolism studies have largely focused on identifying genes controlling major effect loci. To complement these studies, we conducted a replicated metabolomics analysis on a japonica (Lemont) by indica (Teqing) rice recombinant inbred line population and focused on the genetic variation for primary metabolism. Using independent replicated studies, we show that in contrast to other rice studies, the heritability of primary metabolism is similar to Arabidopsis. The vast majority of metabolic QTLs had small to moderate effects with significant polygenic epistasis. Two metabolomics QTL hotspots had opposing effects on carbon and nitrogen rich metabolites suggesting that they may influence carbon and nitrogen partitioning, with one locus co-localizing with SUSIBA2 (WRKY78). Comparing QTLs for metabolomic and a variety of growth related traits identified few overlaps. Interestingly, the rice population displayed fewer loci controlling stochastic variation for metabolism than was found in Arabidopsis. Thus, it is possible that domestication has differentially impacted stochastic metabolite variation more than average metabolite variation.},

A total of 78 loci were associated with GSL traits, and five common and eleven tissue-specific associated loci were related to total leaf and seed GSL content. Thirty-six candidate genes were inferred to be involved in GSL biosynthesis. The candidate gene BnaA03g40190D (BnaA3.MYB28) was validated by DNA polymorphisms and gene expression analysis. This gene was responsible for high leaf/low seed GSL content and could explain 30.62\% of the total leaf GSL variation in the low seed GSL panel and was not fixed during double-low rapeseed breeding.

The distribution of transmitted single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) was significantly different in two subgenomes of B. napus. Gene expression levels were significantly negatively correlated with number of variations in replication and transcription of the corresponding genes, but were positively correlated with the ratios of transmitted SNPs from DNA to RNA.

However, selection of these complex seed quality traits is difficult before haplotypes controlling their contents are identified. To efficiently identify genetic loci influencing these traits and underlying candidate genes and networks, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of eight seed quality traits (oil and protein content, palmitic, stearic, oleic, linoleic, eicosenoic and erucic acids content). The GWAS population comprised 370 diverse accessions, which were phenotyped in five environments and genotyped using 60K SNP arrays. The results indicated that oil and protein contents generally showed negative correlations, while fatty acid contents showed positive or negative correlations, with palmitic and erucic acid contents directly affecting oil content. Seven SNPs on five chromosomes were associated with both seed oil and protein content, and five genes orthologous to genes in Arabidopsis thaliana were predicted as candidates. From resequencing data, besides known haplotypes in BnaA.FAE1.a and BnaC.FAE1.a, three accessions harboring a new haplotype conferring moderate erucic acid content were identified. Interestingly, in a haplotype block, one haplotype was associated with high palmitic acid content and low oil content, while the others showed the reverse effects. This finding was consistent with a negative correlation between palmitic acid and oil contents, suggesting historical selection for high oil content. The identification by this study of genetic variation and complex correlations of eight seed quality traits may be beneficial for crop selection strategies.},

Enhancing the defense effect of GSL and their associated degradation products is an attractive strategy to strengthen the resistance of plants by transgenic approaches. We generated the lines of Brassica napus with three biosynthesis genes involved in GSL metabolic pathway (BnMAM1, BnCYP83A1 and BnUGT74B1), respectively. We then measured the foliar GSLs of each transgenic lines and inoculated them with S. sclerotiorum and B. cinerea. Compared with the wild type control, over-expressing BnUGT74B1 in B. napus increased the aliphatic and indolic GSL levels by 1.7 and 1.5 folds in leaves respectively; while over-expressing BnMAM1 or BnCYP83A1 resulted in an approximate 1.5-fold higher only in the aliphatic GSL level in leaves. The results of plant inoculation demonstrated that BnUGT74B1-overexpressing lines showed less severe disease symptoms and tissue damage compared with the wild type control, but BnMAM1 or BnCYP83A1-overexpressing lines showed no significant difference in comparison to the controls. These results suggest that the resistance to S. sclerotiorum and B. cinerea in B. napus could be enhanced through tailoring the GSL profiles by transgenic approaches or molecular breeding, which provides useful information to assist plant breeders to design improved breeding strategies.},

However, it is not clear whether the transcription factors (TFs) regulating these new enzyme encoding genes were required to co-evolve with these genes in a similar fashion or if these new genes can be captured by existing conserved TFs to provide the appropriate expression pattern. In this study, we found two conserved TFs, MYB115, and MYB118, co-expressed with the key enzyme encoding genes in the newly evolved benzoyloxy glucosinolate (GLS) pathway. These TFs interacted with the promoters of the GLS biosynthetic genes and negatively influenced their expression. Similarly, the GLS profiles of these two TFs knockouts showed that they influenced the aliphatic GLS accumulation within seed, leaf and flower, while they mainly expressed in seeds. Further studies indicated that they are functionally redundant and epistatically interact to control the transcription of GLS genes. Complementation study confirmed their roles in regulating the aliphatic GLS biosynthesis. These results suggest that the newly evolved enzyme encoding genes for novel metabolites can be regulated by conserved TFs, which helps to improve our model for newly evolved genes regulation.},

	abstract = {The proteins of membrane transporters (MTs) are embedded within membrane-bounded organelles and are the prime targets for improvements in the efficiency of water and nutrient transportation. Their function is to maintain cellular homeostasis by controlling ionic movements across cellular channels from roots to upper plant parts, xylem loading and remobilization of sugar molecules from photosynthesis tissues in the leaf (source) to roots, stem and seeds (sink) via phloem loading. The plant’s entire source-to-sink relationship is regulated by multiple transporting proteins in a highly sophisticated manner and driven based on different stages of plant growth and development (PG\&D) and environmental changes. The MTs play a pivotal role in PG\&D in terms of increased plant height, branches/tiller numbers, enhanced numbers, length and filled panicles per plant, seed yield and grain quality. Dynamic climatic changes disturbed ionic balance (salt, drought and heavy metals) and sugar supply (cold and heat stress) in plants. Due to poor selectivity, some of the MTs also uptake toxic elements in roots negatively impact PG\&D and are later on also exported to upper parts where they deteriorate grain quality. As an adaptive strategy, in response to salt and heavy metals, plants activate plasma membranes and vacuolar membrane-localized MTs that export toxic elements into vacuole and also translocate in the root’s tips and shoot. However, in case of drought, cold and heat stresses, MTs increased water and sugar supplies to all organs. In this review, we mainly review recent literature from Arabidopsis, halophytes and major field crops such as rice, wheat, maize and oilseed rape in order to argue the global role of MTs in PG\&D, and abiotic stress tolerance. We also discussed gene expression level changes and genomic variations within a species as well as within a family in response to developmental and environmental cues.},

	abstract = {Transposable elements (TEs) represent a major and variable portion of plant genomes, and recent progress in genetics and genomics has highlighted the importance of different TE species as a useful genetic tool in crop breeding. TEs can cause changes in the pattern of gene expression, and regulate gene function by various means such as cis- up- or down-regulation of nearby genes through insertion at promoter, intron, exon and down-stream regions, and trans-production of short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) via two RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) pathways. siRNAs generated through different RdDM pathways differ in length and have variable effects on TEs. For instance, noncoding siRNAs of 20–60 nt produced by RNA polymerase IV (dicer-independent) and 21/22 nt by Pol II (dicer-dependent) have only minor effects on TEs compared with 24 nt siRNAs produced by Pol IV (dicer-dependent pathways). Following whole-genome duplication (WGD) events after polyploidization in allopolyploids, TEs from either parent are able to induce siRNAs to regulate the complex polyploid genome. Those designated as ‘controllers’ usually reside in the dominant parent and affect the TEs of the recessive parent. Subgenome cross-talk thus appears to contribute to epigenetic regulation as well as reshuffling or restructuring of subgenomes and creation of novel patterns of genes expression/and variation in local or global copy number. In this review, we focus on recent progress in unraveling the role of TEs in gene expression regulation via TE-derived siRNAs in the context of polyploid plant evolution and environmental stress, and explore how ancient WGD and recent polyploidy affected the evolution of TE-induced epigenetic mechanisms.},

For plant breeding, screening of Sclerotinia resistance genes is important. Most F-box genes participated in plant defense response, and LRR regarded as the important domain of resistant genes. Thereby, F-box genes were investigated in this study. Genome-wide identification of F-box-LRR gene in B. napus was conducted by bioinformatics method. Based on published data of tissue expression in Zhongshuang 11 and transcriptome data of inoculation fungi on leaves of susceptible Westar and resistant Zhongyou 821, corresponding Bn-F-box-LRR genes were identified and then verified by qRT-PCR. 161 BnF-box-LRR genes were found and classified into 4 subgroups （FBXLRR1 to FBXLRR4）. The fourth subgroup, FBXLRR4, was significantly different from the other three in the conserved protein distribution and gene structure. It was clustered into the same clade with the homologous genes which involved in plant stress resistance in Arabidopsis thaliana. Therefore, it is speculated that this subgroup might be mainly involved in plant stress response. Based on transcriptome data, it was found that most FBXLRR4 genes were highly expressed in root and leaves, and showed significant expression alternation after S.sclerotiorum induction, indicating these genes potentially in Sclerotinia disease resistant.},

Sequence characterization showed that BnTLK1 had typical transmembrane structure and formed two independent units at 3D structure level. The expression of BnTLK1 was low in different tissues, high expressed in the cultivar 'ZY821' of high resistance to Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, and induced by S. sclerotiorum based on public transcriptome data analysis. To investigate the effect of BnTLK1 on S. sclerotiorum and other fungus, BnTLK1 were expressed in prokaryotic system and get the soluble protein BnTLK1 after overnight induction at 0.4 mmol/L IPTG and 17℃.

The allopolyploid crop species Brassica napus has the most highly duplicated plant genome to be assembled to date, with the largest number of annotated genes.

Examples are provided for use of the genome sequence to identify and capture diversity for important agronomic traits, including seed quality and disease resistance. The increased potential for detailed ge

Intimate knowledge of the highly-duplicated gene space, on the one hand, and the repeat landscape on the other, particularly in comparison to the two diploid progenitor genomes, provide a fundamental basis for new insights into the regulatory mechanisms that are coupled with selection for polyploid success and crop evolution.},

	abstract = {In comparison with retrotransposons, DNA transposons make up a smaller proportion of most plant genomes. However, these elements are often proximal to genes to affect gene expression depending on the activity of the transposons, which is largely reflected by the activity of the transposase genes. Here, we show that three AT-rich introns were retained in the TNP2-like transposase genes of the Bot1 (Brassica oleracea transposon 1) CACTA transposable elements in Brassica oleracea, but were lost in the majority of the Bot1 elements in Brassica rapa. A recent burst of transposition of Bot1 was observed in B. oleracea, but not in B. rapa. This burst of transposition is likely related to the activity of the TNP2-like transposase genes as the expression values of the transposase genes were higher in B. oleracea than in B. rapa. In addition, distinct populations of small RNAs (21, 22 and 24 nt) were detected from the Bot1 elements in B. oleracea, but the vast majority of the small RNAs from the Bot1 elements in B. rapa are 24 nt in length. We hypothesize that the different activity of the TNP2-like transposase genes is likely associated with the three introns, and intron loss is likely reverse transcriptase mediated. Furthermore, we propose that the Bot1 family is currently undergoing silencing in B. oleracea, but has already been silenced in B. rapa. Taken together, our data provide new insights into the differentiation of transposons and their role in the asymmetric evolution of these two closely related Brassica species.},

To overcome this problem, we applied a single-molecule long-read isoform sequencing (Iso-Seq) technique that can produce long reads to explore the complex transcriptome of B. napus at the isoform level. From the Iso-Seq data, we obtained 147 698 non-redundant isoforms, capturing 37 403 annotated genes. A total of 18.1\% (14 934/82 367) of the multi-exonic genes showed alternative splicing (AS).

Moreover, 31 591 AS events located in open reading frames (ORFs) lead to potential protein isoforms by in-frame or frameshift changes in the ORF. Illumina RNA sequencing of five tissues that were pooled for Iso-Seq was also performed and showed that 69\% of the AS events were tissue-specific.

To screen flower-specific promoters, we first analyzed the transcriptome data from 12 different tissues of the B. napus line ZS11. In total, 249 flower-specific candidate genes with high expression in petals were identified, and the expression patterns of 30 candidate genes were verified by quantitative real-time transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis. Furthermore, two novel flower-specific promoters (FSP046 and FSP061 promoter) were identified, and the tissue specificity and continuous expression in petals were determined in transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana with fusing the promoters to β-glucuronidase (GUS)-reporter gene. GUS staining, transcript expression pattern, and GUS activity analysis indicated that FSP046 and FSP061 promoter were strictly flower-specific promoters, and FSP046 promoter had a stronger activity. The two promoters were further confirmed to be able to direct GUS expression in B. napus flowers using transient expression system.

Within a short evolutionary period ({\textasciitilde}6700 years ago), semi-winter-type 'ZS11' and the winter-type 'Darmor-bzh' maintained highly genomic collinearity. Even so, certain genetic differences were also detected in two morphotypes. Relative to 'Darmor-bzh', both two subgenomes of 'ZS11' are closely related to its progenitors, and the 'ZS11' genome harbored several specific segmental homoeologous exchanges (HEs). Furthermore, the semi-winter-type 'ZS11' underwent potential genomic introgressions with B. rapa (Ar ). Some of these genetic differences were associated with key agronomic traits. A key gene of A03.FLC3 regulating vernalization-responsive flowering time in 'ZS11' was first experienced HE, and then underwent genomic introgression event with Ar , which potentially has led to genetic differences in controlling vernalization in the semi-winter types. Our observations improved our understanding of the genetic diversity of different B. napus morphotypes and the cultivation history of semi-winter oilseed rape in Asia.},

	abstract = {It has been well documented that most nuclear protein-coding genes in organisms can be classified into two categories: positively selected genes (PSGs) and negatively selected genes (NSGs). The characteristics and evolutionary fates of different types of genes, however, have been poorly understood. In this study, the rates of nonsynonymous substitution (Ka ) and the rates of synonymous substitution (Ks ) were investigated by comparing the orthologs between the two sequenced Brassica species, Brassica rapa and Brassica oleracea, and the evolutionary rates, gene structures, expression patterns, and codon bias were compared between PSGs and NSGs. The resulting data show that PSGs have higher protein evolutionary rates, lower synonymous substitution rates, shorter gene length, fewer exons, higher functional specificity, lower expression level, higher tissue-specific expression and stronger codon bias than NSGs. Although the quantities and values are different, the relative features of PSGs and NSGs have been largely verified in the model species Arabidopsis. These data suggest that PSGs and NSGs differ not only under selective pressure (Ka /Ks ), but also in their evolutionary, structural and functional properties, indicating that selective modes may serve as a determinant factor for measuring evolutionary rates, gene compactness and expression patterns in Brassica.},

DA1 (DA means big in Chinese) is an ubiquitin receptor and negatively regulates seed size. Down-regulation of AtDA1 in Arabidopsis leads to larger seeds and organs by increasing cell proliferation in integuments. In this study, BnDA1 was down-regulated in B. napus by over expressed of AtDA1R358K , which is a functional deficiency of DA1 with an arginine-to-lysine mutation at the 358th amino acid. The results showed that the biomass and size of the seeds, cotyledons, leaves, flowers and siliques of transgenic plants all increased significantly. In particular, the 1000 seed weight increased 21.23\% and the seed yield per plant increased 13.22\% in field condition. The transgenic plants had no negative traits related to yield. The candidate gene association analysis demonstrated that the BnDA1 locus was contributed to the seeds weight. Therefore, our study showed that regulation of DA1 in B. napus can increase the seed yield and biomass, and DA1 is a promising target for crop improvement.},

These were developed using existing coding DNA sequence (CDS) gene models from the now-published Brassica oleracea TO1000 and Brassica napus Darmor-bzh genome sequence assemblies representing the chromosomes of these species, along with preliminary CDS models from an updated Brassica rapa Chiifu genome sequence assembly. The B. rapa genome sequence scaffolds required splitting and re-ordering to match the expected genome organisation based on a high density SNP linkage map, but the B. oleracea assembly was used unchanged. The resulting B. rapa (A genome) pseudomolecules contained 47,656 ordered CDS models and the B. oleracea (C genome) pseudomolecules contained 54,766 ordered CDS models. Interpolation of B. napus CDS models not already represented by orthologues resulted in 52,790 and 63,308 ordered CDS models in the A and C pan-transcriptomes, an increase of 13,676 overall. Comparison of the organisation of this resource with publicly available genome sequences for B. napus showed excellent consistency for the B. napus Darmor-bzh resource, but more breakdown of collinearity for the B. napus ZS11 resource.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Oil crop seeds are important sources of fatty acids (FAs) for human and animal nutrition. Despite their importance, there is a lack of an essential bioinformatics resource on gene transcription of oil crops from a comparative perspective. In this study, we developed ocsESTdb, the first database of expressed sequence tag (EST) information on seeds of four large-scale oil crops with an emphasis on global metabolic networks and oil accumulation metabolism that target the involved unigenes.
DESCRIPTION: A total of 248,522 ESTs and 106,835 unigenes were collected from the cDNA libraries of rapeseed (Brassica napus), soybean (Glycine max), sesame (Sesamum indicum) and peanut (Arachis hypogaea). These unigenes were annotated by a sequence similarity search against databases including TAIR, NR protein database, Gene Ontology, COG, Swiss-Prot, TrEMBL and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG). Five genome-scale metabolic networks that contain different numbers of metabolites and gene-enzyme reaction-association entries were analysed and constructed using Cytoscape and yEd programs. Details of unigene entries, deduced amino acid sequences and putative annotation are available from our database to browse, search and download. Intuitive and graphical representations of EST/unigene sequences, functional annotations, metabolic pathways and metabolic networks are also available. ocsESTdb will be updated regularly and can be freely accessed at http://ocri-genomics.org/ocsESTdb/ .
CONCLUSION: ocsESTdb may serve as a valuable and unique resource for comparative analysis of acyl lipid synthesis and metabolism in oilseed plants. It also may provide vital insights into improving oil content in seeds of oil crop species by transcriptional reconstruction of the metabolic network.},

We examined the B. napus genome and the consequences of its recent duplication. The constituent An and Cn subgenomes are engaged in subtle structural, functional, and epigenetic cross-talk, with abundant homeologous exchanges. Incipient gene loss and expression divergence have begun. Selection in B. napus oilseed types has accelerated the loss of glucosinolate genes, while preserving expansion of oil biosynthesis genes.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: MITE, TRIM and SINEs are miniature form transposable elements (mTEs) that are ubiquitous and dispersed throughout entire plant genomes. Tens of thousands of members cause insertion polymorphism at both the inter- and intra- species level. Therefore, mTEs are valuable targets and resources for development of markers that can be utilized for breeding, genetic diversity and genome evolution studies. Taking advantage of the completely sequenced genomes of Brassica rapa and B. oleracea, characterization of mTEs and building a curated database are prerequisite to extending their utilization for genomics and applied fields in Brassica crops.
FINDINGS: We have developed BrassicaTED as a unique web portal containing detailed characterization information for mTEs of Brassica species. At present, BrassicaTED has datasets for 41 mTE families, including 5894 and 6026 members from 20 MITE families, 1393 and 1639 members from 5 TRIM families, 1270 and 2364 members from 16 SINE families in B. rapa and B. oleracea, respectively. BrassicaTED offers different sections to browse structural and positional characteristics for every mTE family. In addition, we have added data on 289 MITE insertion polymorphisms from a survey of seven Brassica relatives. Genes with internal mTE insertions are shown with detailed gene annotation and microarray-based comparative gene expression data in comparison with their paralogs in the triplicated B. rapa genome. This database also includes a novel tool, K BLAST (Karyotype BLAST), for clear visualization of the locations for each member in the B. rapa and B. oleracea pseudo-genome sequences.
CONCLUSIONS: BrassicaTED is a newly developed database of information regarding the characteristics and potential utility of mTEs including MITE, TRIM and SINEs in B. rapa and B. oleracea. The database will promote the development of desirable mTE-based markers, which can be utilized for genomics and breeding in Brassica species. BrassicaTED will be a valuable repository for scientists and breeders, promoting efficient research on Brassica species.

Here, we conducted genome-wide comparative analysis of 20 MITE families in B. rapa, B. oleracea, and Arabidopsis thaliana. A total of 5894 and 6026 MITE members belonging to the 20 families were found in the whole genome pseudo-chromosome sequences of B. rapa and B. oleracea, respectively. Meanwhile, only four of the 20 families, comprising 573 members, were identified in the Arabidopsis genome, indicating that most of the families were activated in the Brassica genus after divergence from Arabidopsis. Copy numbers varied from 4 to 1459 for each MITE family, and there was up to 6-fold variation between B. rapa and B. oleracea. In particular, analysis of intact members showed that whereas eleven families were present in similar copy numbers in B. rapa and B. oleracea, nine families showed copy number variation ranging from 2- to 16-fold. Four of those families (BraSto-3, BraTo-3, 4, 5) were more abundant in B. rapa, and the other five (BraSto-1, BraSto-4, BraTo-1, 7 and BraHAT-1) were more abundant in B. oleracea. Overall, 54\% and 51\% of the MITEs resided in or within 2 kb of a gene in the B. rapa and B. oleracea genomes, respectively. Notably, 92 MITEs were found within the CDS of annotated genes, suggesting that MITEs might play roles in diversification of genes in the recently triplicated Brassica genome. MITE insertion polymorphism (MIP) analysis of 289 MITE members showed that 52\% and 23\% were polymorphic at the inter- and intra-species levels, respectively, indicating that there has been recent MITE activity in the Brassica genome. These recently activated MITE families with abundant MIP will provide useful resources for molecular breeding and identification of novel functional genes arising from MITE insertion.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sesame, Sesamum indicum L., is considered the queen of oilseeds for its high oil content and quality, and is grown widely in tropical and subtropical areas as an important source of oil and protein. However, the molecular biology of sesame is largely unexplored.
RESULTS: Here, we report a high-quality genome sequence of sesame assembled de novo with a contig N50 of 52.2 kb and a scaffold N50 of 2.1 Mb, containing an estimated 27,148 genes. The results reveal novel, independent whole genome duplication and the absence of the Toll/interleukin-1 receptor domain in resistance genes. Candidate genes and oil biosynthetic pathways contributing to high oil content were discovered by comparative genomic and transcriptomic analyses. These revealed the expansion of type 1 lipid transfer genes by tandem duplication, the contraction of lipid degradation genes, and the differential expression of essential genes in the triacylglycerol biosynthesis pathway, particularly in the early stage of seed development. Resequencing data in 29 sesame accessions from 12 countries suggested that the high genetic diversity of lipid-related genes might be associated with the wide variation in oil content. Additionally, the results shed light on the pivotal stage of seed development, oil accumulation and potential key genes for sesamin production, an important pharmacological constituent of sesame.
CONCLUSIONS: As an important species from the order Lamiales and a high oil crop, the sesame genome will facilitate future research on the evolution of eudicots, as well as the study of lipid biosynthesis and potential genetic improvement of sesame.},

	abstract = {Although much research has been conducted, the pattern of microsatellite distribution has remained ambiguous, and the development/utilization of microsatellite markers has still been limited/inefficient in Brassica, due to the lack of genome sequences. In view of this, we conducted genome-wide microsatellite characterization and marker development in three recently sequenced Brassica crops: Brassica rapa, Brassica oleracea and Brassica napus. The analysed microsatellite characteristics of these Brassica species were highly similar or almost identical, which suggests that the pattern of microsatellite distribution is likely conservative in Brassica. The genomic distribution of microsatellites was highly non-uniform and positively or negatively correlated with genes or transposable elements, respectively. Of the total of 115 869, 185 662 and 356 522 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers developed with high frequencies (408.2, 343.8 and 356.2 per Mb or one every 2.45, 2.91 and 2.81 kb, respectively), most represented new SSR markers, the majority had determined physical positions, and a large number were genic or putative single-locus SSR markers. We also constructed a comprehensive database for the newly developed SSR markers, which was integrated with public Brassica SSR markers and annotated genome components. The genome-wide SSR markers developed in this study provide a useful tool to extend the annotated genome resources of sequenced Brassica species to genetic study/breeding in different Brassica species.},

	doi = {10.1186/1471-2164-14-689},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The species Brassica rapa (2n=20, AA) is an important vegetable and oilseed crop, and serves as an excellent model for genomic and evolutionary research in Brassica species. With the availability of whole genome sequence of B. rapa, it is essential to further determine the activity of all functional elements of the B. rapa genome and explore the transcriptome on a genome-wide scale. Here, RNA-seq data was employed to provide a genome-wide transcriptional landscape and characterization of the annotated and novel transcripts and alternative splicing events across tissues.
RESULTS: RNA-seq reads were generated using the Illumina platform from six different tissues (root, stem, leaf, flower, silique and callus) of the B. rapa accession Chiifu-401-42, the same line used for whole genome sequencing. First, these data detected the widespread transcription of the B. rapa genome, leading to the identification of numerous novel transcripts and definition of 5'/3' UTRs of known genes. Second, 78.8\% of the total annotated genes were detected as expressed and 45.8\% were constitutively expressed across all tissues. We further defined several groups of genes: housekeeping genes, tissue-specific expressed genes and co-expressed genes across tissues, which will serve as a valuable repository for future crop functional genomics research. Third, alternative splicing (AS) is estimated to occur in more than 29.4\% of intron-containing B. rapa genes, and 65\% of them were commonly detected in more than two tissues. Interestingly, genes with high rate of AS were over-represented in GO categories relating to transcriptional regulation and signal transduction, suggesting potential importance of AS for playing regulatory role in these genes. Further, we observed that intron retention (IR) is predominant in the AS events and seems to preferentially occurred in genes with short introns.
CONCLUSIONS: The high-resolution RNA-seq analysis provides a global transcriptional landscape as a complement to the B. rapa genome sequence, which will advance our understanding of the dynamics and complexity of the B. rapa transcriptome. The atlas of gene expression in different tissues will be useful for accelerating research on functional genomics and genome evolution in Brassica species.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Brassica oleracea is a morphologically diverse species in the family Brassicaceae and contains a group of nutrition-rich vegetable crops, including common heading cabbage, cauliflower, broccoli, kohlrabi, kale, Brussels sprouts. This diversity along with its phylogenetic membership in a group of three diploid and three tetraploid species, and the recent availability of genome sequences within Brassica provide an unprecedented opportunity to study intra- and inter-species divergence and evolution in this species and its close relatives.
DESCRIPTION: We have developed a comprehensive database, Bolbase, which provides access to the B. oleracea genome data and comparative genomics information. The whole genome of B. oleracea is available, including nine fully assembled chromosomes and 1,848 scaffolds, with 45,758 predicted genes, 13,382 transposable elements, and 3,581 non-coding RNAs. Comparative genomics information is available, including syntenic regions among B. oleracea, Brassica rapa and Arabidopsis thaliana, synonymous (Ks) and non-synonymous (Ka) substitution rates between orthologous gene pairs, gene families or clusters, and differences in quantity, category, and distribution of transposable elements on chromosomes. Bolbase provides useful search and data mining tools, including a keyword search, a local BLAST server, and a customized GBrowse tool, which can be used to extract annotations of genome components, identify similar sequences and visualize syntenic regions among species. Users can download all genomic data and explore comparative genomics in a highly visual setting.
CONCLUSIONS: Bolbase is the first resource platform for the B. oleracea genome and for genomic comparisons with its relatives, and thus it will help the research community to better study the function and evolution of Brassica genomes as well as enhance molecular breeding research. This database will be updated regularly with new features, improvements to genome annotation, and new genomic sequences as they become available.

	abstract = {Recent sequencing of the Brassica rapa and Brassica oleracea genomes revealed extremely contrasting genomic features such as the abundance and distribution of transposable elements between the two genomes. However, whether and how these structural differentiations may have influenced the evolutionary rates of the two genomes since their split from a common ancestor are unknown. Here, we investigated and compared the rates of nucleotide substitution between two long terminal repeats (LTRs) of individual orthologous LTR-retrotransposons, the rates of synonymous and non-synonymous substitution among triplicated genes retained in both genomes from a shared whole genome triplication event, and the rates of genetic recombination estimated/deduced by the comparison of physical and genetic distances along chromosomes and ratios of solo LTRs to intact elements. Overall, LTR sequences and genic sequences showed more rapid nucleotide substitution in B. rapa than in B. oleracea. Synonymous substitution of triplicated genes retained from a shared whole genome triplication was detected at higher rates in B. rapa than in B. oleracea. Interestingly, non-synonymous substitution was observed at lower rates in the former than in the latter, indicating shifted densities of purifying selection between the two genomes. In addition to evolutionary asymmetry, orthologous genes differentially regulated and/or disrupted by transposable elements between the two genomes were also characterized. Our analyses suggest that local genomic and epigenomic features, such as recombination rates and chromatin dynamics reshaped by independent proliferation of transposable elements and elimination between the two genomes, are perhaps partially the causes and partially the outcomes of the observed inter-specific asymmetric evolution.},

	abstract = {Despite their ubiquity and functional importance, microsatellites have been largely ignored in comparative genomics, mostly due to the lack of genomic information. In the current study, microsatellite distribution was characterized and compared in the whole genomes and both the coding and non-coding DNA sequences of the sequenced Brassica, Arabidopsis and other angiosperm species to investigate their evolutionary dynamics in plants. The variation in the microsatellite frequencies of these angiosperm species was much smaller than those for their microsatellite numbers and genome sizes, suggesting that microsatellite frequency may be relatively stable in plants. The microsatellite frequencies of these angiosperm species were significantly negatively correlated with both their genome sizes and transposable elements contents. The pattern of microsatellite distribution may differ according to the different genomic regions (such as coding and non-coding sequences). The observed differences in many important microsatellite characteristics (especially the distribution with respect to motif length, type and repeat number) of these angiosperm species were generally accordant with their phylogenetic distance, which suggested that the evolutionary dynamics of microsatellite distribution may be generally consistent with plant divergence/evolution. Importantly, by comparing these microsatellite characteristics (especially the distribution with respect to motif type) the angiosperm species (aside from a few species) all clustered into two obviously different groups that were largely represented by monocots and dicots, suggesting a complex and generally dichotomous evolutionary pattern of microsatellite distribution in angiosperms. Polyploidy may lead to a slight increase in microsatellite frequency in the coding sequences and a significant decrease in microsatellite frequency in the whole genome/non-coding sequences, but have little effect on the microsatellite distribution with respect to motif length, type and repeat number. Interestingly, several microsatellite characteristics seemed to be constant in plant evolution, which can be well explained by the general biological rules.},

	volume = {8},
	issn = {1746-4811},
	doi = {10.1186/1746-4811-8-34},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) marker is an invaluable tool for positional cloning, association study and evolutionary analysis, low SNP detection efficiency by Allele-Specific PCR (AS-PCR) still restricts its application as molecular marker like other markers such as Simple Sequence Repeat (SSR). To overcome this problem, primers with a single nucleotide artificial mismatch introduced within the three bases closest to the 3'end (SNP site) have been used in AS-PCR. However, for one SNP site, nine possible mismatches can be generated among the three bases and how to select the right one to increase primer specificity is still a challenge.
RESULTS: In this study, different from the previous reports which used a limited quantity of primers randomly (several or dozen pairs), we systematically investigated the effects of mismatch base pairs, mismatch sites and SNP types on primer specificity with 2071 primer pairs, which were designed based on SNPs from Brassica oleracea 01-88 and 02-12. According to the statistical results, we (1) found that the primers designed with SNP (A/T), in which the mismatch (CA) in the 3rd nucleotide from the 3' end, had the highest allele-specificity (81.9\%). This information could be used when designing primers from a large quantity of SNP sites; (2) performed the primer design principle which forms the one and only best primer for every SNP type. This is never reported in previous studies. Additionally, we further identified its availability in rapeseed (Brassica napus L.) and sesame (Sesamum indicum). High polymorphism percent (75\%) of the designed primers indicated it is a general method and can be applied in other species.
CONCLUSION: The method provided in this study can generate primers more effectively for every SNP site compared to other AS-PCR primer design methods. The high allele-specific efficiency of the SNP primer allows the feasibility for low- to moderate- throughput SNP analyses and is much suitable for gene mapping, map-based cloning, and marker-assisted selection in crops.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Brassica oleracea encompass a family of vegetables and cabbage that are among the most widely cultivated crops. In 2009, the B. oleracea Genome Sequencing Project was launched using next generation sequencing technology. None of the available maps were detailed enough to anchor the sequence scaffolds for the Genome Sequencing Project. This report describes the development of a large number of SSR and SNP markers from the whole genome shotgun sequence data of B. oleracea, and the construction of a high-density genetic linkage map using a double haploid mapping population.
RESULTS: The B. oleracea high-density genetic linkage map that was constructed includes 1,227 markers in nine linkage groups spanning a total of 1197.9 cM with an average of 0.98 cM between adjacent loci. There were 602 SSR markers and 625 SNP markers on the map. The chromosome with the highest number of markers (186) was C03, and the chromosome with smallest number of markers (99) was C09.
CONCLUSIONS: This first high-density map allowed the assembled scaffolds to be anchored to pseudochromosomes. The map also provides useful information for positional cloning, molecular breeding, and integration of information of genes and traits in B. oleracea. All the markers on the map will be transferable and could be used for the construction of other genetic maps.},

	doi = {10.1186/1471-2229-11-180},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sesame (Sesamum indicum) is one of the most important oilseed crops with high oil contents and rich nutrient value. However, genetic improvement efforts in sesame could not get benefit from molecular biology technology due to poor DNA and RNA sequence resources. In this study, we carried out a large scale of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) sequencing from developing sesame seeds and further conducted analysis on seed storage products-related genes.
RESULTS: A normalized and full-length enriched cDNA library from 5 {\textasciitilde} 30 days old immature seeds was constructed and randomly sequenced, leading to generation of 41,248 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) which then formed 4,713 contigs and 27,708 singletons with 44.9\% uniESTs being putative full-length open reading frames. Approximately 26,091 of all these uniESTs have significant matches to the counterparts in Nr database of GenBank, and 21,628 of them were assigned to one or more Gene ontology (GO) terms. Homologous genes involved in oil biosynthesis were identified including some conservative transcription factors regulating oil biosynthesis such as LEAFY COTYLEDON1 (LEC1), PICKLE (PKL), WRINKLED1 (WRI1) and majority of them were found for the first time in sesame seeds. One hundred and 17 ESTs were identified possibly involved in biosynthesis of sesame lignans, sesamin and sesamolin. In total, 9,347 putative functional genes from developing seeds were identified, which accounts for one third of total genes in the sesame genome. Further analysis of the uniESTs identified 1,949 non-redundant simple sequence repeats (SSRs).
CONCLUSIONS: This study has provided an overview of genes expressed during sesame seed development. This collection of sesame full-length cDNAs covered a wide variety of genes in seeds, in particular, candidate genes involved in biosynthesis of sesame oils and lignans. These EST sequences enriched with full length will contribute to comparative genomic studies on sesame and other oilseed plants and serve as an abundant information platform for functional marker development and functional gene study.},

Meanwhile, the Brassica species represent an excellent system for studying numerous aspects of plant biology, specifically for the analysis of genome evolution following polyploidy, so it is also very important for scientific research. Now, the genome of Brassica rapa has already been assembled, it is the time to do deep mining of the genome data.
DESCRIPTION: BRAD, the Brassica database, is a web-based resource focusing on genome scale genetic and genomic data for important Brassica crops. BRAD was built based on the first whole genome sequence and on further data analysis of the Brassica A genome species, Brassica rapa (Chiifu-401-42). It provides datasets, such as the complete genome sequence of B. rapa, which was de novo assembled from Illumina GA II short reads and from BAC clone sequences, predicted genes and associated annotations, non coding RNAs, transposable elements (TE), B. rapa genes' orthologous to those in A. thaliana, as well as genetic markers and linkage maps. BRAD offers useful searching and data mining tools, including search across annotation datasets, search for syntenic or non-syntenic orthologs, and to search the flanking regions of a certain target, as well as the tools of BLAST and Gbrowse. BRAD allows users to enter almost any kind of information, such as a B. rapa or A. thaliana gene ID, physical position or genetic marker.
CONCLUSION: BRAD, a new database which focuses on the genetics and genomics of the Brassica plants has been developed, it aims at helping scientists and breeders to fully and efficiently use the information of genome data of Brassica plants. BRAD will be continuously updated and can be accessed through http://brassicadb.org.},

To address this challenge, we sequenced leaf transcriptomes across a mapping population of the polyploid crop oilseed rape (Brassica napus) and representative ancestors of the parents of the population. Analysis of sequence variation and transcript abundance enabled us to construct twin single nucleotide polymorphism linkage maps of B. napus, comprising 23,037 markers. We used these to align the B. napus genome with that of a related species, Arabidopsis thaliana, and to genome sequence assemblies of its progenitor species, Brassica rapa and Brassica oleracea. We also developed methods to detect genome rearrangements and track inheritance of genomic segments, including the outcome of an interspecific cross. By revealing the genetic consequences of breeding, cost-effective, high-resolution dissection of crop genomes by transcriptome sequencing will increase the efficiency of predictive breeding even in the absence of a complete genome sequence.},

Despite the identification of several Avr effectors and R (race-specific) genes, specific interactions between Avr-R genes are not yet fully understood in the Brassica napus-L. maculans pathosystem. In this study, we investigated the genetic basis of resistance in an F2 : 3 population derived from Australian canola varieties CB-Telfer (Rlm4)/ATR-Cobbler (Rlm4) using a single-spore isolate of L. maculans, PHW1223. A genetic linkage map of the CB-Telfer/ATR-Cobbler population was constructed using 7,932 genotyping-by-sequencing-based DArTseq markers and subsequently utilized for linkage and haplotype analyses. Genetic linkage between DArTseq markers and resistance to PHW1223 isolate was also validated using the B. napus 60K Illumina Infinium array. Our results revealed that a major locus for resistance, designated as Rlm13, maps on chromosome C03. To date, no R gene for resistance to blackleg has been reported on the C subgenome in B. napus. Twenty-four candidate R genes were predicted to reside within the quantitative trait locus (QTL) region. We further resequenced both the parental lines of the mapping population (CB-Telfer and ATR-Cobbler, {\textgreater} 80 × coverage) and identified several structural sequence variants in the form of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), insertions/deletions (InDels), and presence/absence variations (PAVs) near Rlm13. Comparative mapping revealed that Rlm13 is located within the homoeologous A03/C03 region in ancestral karyotype block "R" of Brassicaceae. Our results provide a "target" for further understanding the Avr-Rlm13 gene interaction as well as a valuable tool for increasing resistance to blackleg in canola germplasm.},

	abstract = {Blackleg disease, caused by the fungal pathogen Leptosphaeria maculans, continues to be a major concern for sustainable production of canola (Brassica napus L.) in many parts of the world. The deployment of effective quantitative resistance (QR) is recognized as a durable strategy in providing natural defense to pathogens. Herein, we uncover loci for resistance to blackleg in a genetically diverse panel of canola accessions by exploiting historic recombination events which occurred during domestication and selective breeding by genome-wide association analysis (GWAS). We found extensive variation in resistance to blackleg at the adult plant stage, including for upper canopy infection. Using the linkage disequilibrium and genetic relationship estimates from 12,414 high quality SNPs, GWAS identified 59 statistically significant and "suggestive" SNPs on 17 chromosomes of B. napus genome that underlie variation in resistance to blackleg, evaluated under field and shade-house conditions. Each of the SNP association accounted for up to 25.1\% of additive genetic variance in resistance among diverse panel of accessions. To understand the homology of QR genomic regions with Arabidopsis thaliana genome, we searched the synteny between QR regions with 22 ancestral blocks of Brassicaceae. Comparative analyses revealed that 25 SNP associations for QR were localized in nine ancestral blocks, as a result of genomic rearrangements. We further showed that phenological traits such as flowering time, plant height, and maturity confound the genetic variation in resistance. Altogether, these findings provided new insights on the complex genetic control of the blackleg resistance and further expanded our understanding of its genetic architecture.},

However, the CCCH-mediated defense mechanisms against necrotrophic pathogens are unclear. Here, we report that the Arabidopsis CCCH protein C3H14 positively regulates basal defense against B. cinerea mainly by WRKY33 signaling. Simultaneous mutation of C3H14 and its paralog C3H15 resulted in enhanced susceptibility to B. cinerea, while C3H14 or C3H15 overexpression lines exhibited reduced susceptibility. A large number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were present in the c3h14c3h15 double mutant and C3H14 overexpression plants compared with wild-type plants at 24 hr post infection. These DEGs covered over one third of B. cinerea-responsive WRKY33 targets, including genes involved in jasmonic acid (JA)/ethylene (ET) signaling, and camalexin biosynthesis. Genetic analysis indicated that C3H14 mainly depended on WRKY33 to modulate defense against B. cinerea. Moreover, C3H14 activated the WRKY33-ORA59 and -PAD3 cascades to correspondingly control JA/ET- and camalexin-mediated defense responses. However, C3H14 was essential for B. cinerea-induced production of 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid and it also directly mediated ORA59-dependent JA/ET signaling after infection. Therefore, C3H14 may act as a novel transcriptional regulator of the WRKY33-mediated defense pathway.},

Resistance response of B. napus against S. sclerotiorum exhibits a typical quantitative disease resistance (QDR) characteristic, but the molecular determinants of this QDR are largely unknown. In this study, we isolated a B. napus mitogen-activated protein kinase gene, BnaMPK6, and found that BnaMPK6 expression is highly responsive to infection by S. sclerotiorum and treatment with salicylic acid (SA) or jasmonic acid (JA). Moreover, overexpression (OE) of BnaMPK6 significantly enhances resistance to S. sclerotiorum, whereas RNAi in BnaMPK6 significantly reduces this resistance. These results showed that BnaMPK6 plays an important role in defense to S. sclerotiorum. Furthermore, expression of defense genes associated with SA-, JA- and ethylene (ET)-mediated signaling was investigated in BnaMPK6-RNAi, WT and BnaMPK6-OE plants after S. sclerotiorum infection, and consequently, it was indicated that the activation of ET signaling by BnaMPK6 may play a role in the defense. Further, four BnaMPK6-encoding homologous loci were mapped in the B. napus genome. Using the allele analysis and expression analysis on the four loci, we demonstrated that the locus BnaA03.MPK6 makes an important contribution to QDR against S. sclerotiorum. Our data indicated that BnaMPK6 is a previously unknown determinant of QDR against S. sclerotiorum in B. napus.},

To date, the genetic mechanisms of rapeseed' interactions with S. sclerotiorum are not fully understood, and molecular-based breeding is still the most effective control strategy for this disease. Here, Arabidopsis thaliana GDSL1 was characterized as an extracellular GDSL lipase gene functioning in Sclerotinia resistance. Loss of AtGDSL1 function resulted in enhanced susceptibility to S. sclerotiorum. Conversely, overexpression of AtGDSL1 in B. napus enhanced resistance, which was associated with increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) and salicylic acid (SA) levels, and reduced jasmonic acid levels. In addition, AtGDSL1 can cause an increase in lipid precursor phosphatidic acid levels, which may lead to the activation of downstream ROS/SA defence-related pathways. However, the rapeseed BnGDSL1 with highest sequence similarity to AtGDSL1 had no effect on SSR resistance. A candidate gene association study revealed that only one AtGDSL1 homolog from rapeseed, BnaC07g35650D (BnGLIP1), significantly contributed to resistance traits in a natural B. napus population, and the resistance function was also confirmed by a transient expression assay in tobacco leaves. Moreover, genomic analyses revealed that BnGLIP1 locus was embedded in a selected region associated with SSR resistance during the breeding process, and its elite allele type belonged to a minor allele in the population. Thus, BnGLIP1 is the functional equivalent of AtGDSL1 and has a broad application in rapeseed S. sclerotiorum-resistance breeding.},

Identification of important genes in the defense responses is critical for molecular breeding, an important strategy for controlling the disease. Here, we report that a B. napus mitogen-activated protein kinase gene, BnaMPK3, plays an important role in the defense against S. sclerotiorum in oilseed rape. BnaMPK3 is highly expressed in the stems, flowers and leaves, and its product is localized in the nucleus. Furthermore, BnaMPK3 is highly responsive to infection by S. sclerotiorum and treatment with jasmonic acid (JA) or the biosynthesis precursor of ethylene (ET), but not to treatment with salicylic acid (SA) or abscisic acid. Moreover, overexpression (OE) of BnaMPK3 in B. napus and Nicotiana benthamiana results in significantly enhanced resistance to S. sclerotiorum, whereas resistance is diminished in RNAi transgenic plants. After S. sclerotiorum infection, defense responses associated with ET, JA, and SA signaling are intensified in the BnaMPK3-OE plants but weakened in the BnaMPK3-RNAi plants when compared to those in the wild type plants; by contrast the level of both H2O2 accumulation and cell death exhibits a reverse pattern. The candidate gene association analyses show that the BnaMPK3-encoding BnaA06g18440D locus is a cause of variation in the resistance to S. sclerotiorum in natural B. napus population. These results suggest that BnaMPK3 is a key regulator of multiple defense responses to S. sclerotiorum, which may guide the resistance improvement of oilseed rape and related economic crops.},

Here, we mapped quantitative trait loci (QTL) for stem rot resistance (SRR), a disease caused by the fungus Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, and flowering time (FT) in a recombinant inbred line population. The population was genotyped using B. napus 60K single nucleotide polymorphism arrays and phenotyped in six (FT) and nine (SSR) experimental conditions or environments. In total, we detected 30 SRR QTL and 22 FT QTL and show that some of the major QTL associated with these two traits were co-localized, suggesting a genetic linkage between them. Two SRR QTL on chromosome A2 and two on chromosome C2 were shown to be syntenic, suggesting the functional conservation of these regions. We used the syntenic properties of the genomic regions to exclude genes for selection candidates responsible for QTL-associated traits. For example, 152 of the 185 genes could be excluded from a syntenic A2-C2 region. These findings will help to elucidate polyploid genomics in future studies, in addition to providing useful information for B. napus breeding programs.},

Physiological investigation of redox homeostasis was further studied by quantifying cellular levels of the glutathione and ascorbate redox pathway and the cycling enzymes associated with host tolerance to S. sclerotiorum.

Up to now, they have been reported in some insects, vertebrate and invertebrate animals, but are not found in plants. In this study, we performed an in silico screening of antimicrobial peptides, which led to discovery of a Brassica napus gene encoding a novel PR-AMP. This gene encodes a 35-amino acid peptide with 13 proline residues, designated BnPRP1. BnPRP1 has 40.5\% identity with a known proline-rich antimicrobial peptide SP-B from the pig. BnPRP1 was artificially synthetized and cloned into the prokaryotic expression vector pET30a/His-EDDIE-GFP. Recombinant BnPRP1 was produced in Escherichia coli and has a predicted molecular mass of 3.8 kDa. Analysis of its activity demonstrated that BnPRP1 exhibited strong antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacterium, Gram-negative bacterium, yeast and also had strong antifungal activity against several pathogenic fungi, such as Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, Mucor sp., Magnaporthe oryzae and Botrytis cinerea. Circular dichroism (CD) revealed the main secondary structure of BnPRP1 was the random coil. BnPRP1 gene expression detected by qRT-PCR is responsive to pathogen inoculation. At 48 hours after S. sclerotiorum inoculation, the expression of BnPRP1 increased significantly in the susceptible lines while slight decrease occurred in resistant lines. These suggested that BnPRP1 might play a role in the plant defense response against S. sclerotiorum. BnPRP1 isolated from B. napus was the first PR-AMP member that was characterized in plants, and its homology sequences were found in some other Brassicaceae plants by the genome sequences analysis. Compared with the known PR-AMPs, BnPRP1 has the different primary sequences and antimicrobial activity. Above all, this study gives a chance to cast a new light on further understanding about the AMPs' mechanism and application.},

Zhongshuang No. 6) plants. These three viruses are Oilseed rape mosaic virus (ORMV), Turnip mosaic virus (TuMV) and Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV). The native BnSGS3 expressed in all examined tissues with the highest expression in siliques. All three viruses induced BnSGS3 expression, but ORMV induced a dramatic increase in the BnSGS3-Ov plants, followed by TuMV and CMV. Upon inoculation with three different viruses, transcript abundance of BnSGS3 gene follows: BnSGS3-Ov {\textgreater} non-transgenic plants {\textgreater} BnSGS3-Si. The accumulation quantities of ORMV and TuMV exhibited a similar trend. However, CMV accumulation showed an opposite trend where virus accumulations were negatively correlated with BnSGS3 expression. The results suggest that BnSGS3 selectively inhibits CMV accumulation but promotes ORMV and TuMV accumulation. BnSGS3 should be used in different ways (up- and down-regulation) for breeding virus-resistant oilseed rape varieties.},

To identify oilseed rape miRNAs, we deep-sequenced two small RNA libraries made from V. longisporum infected/noninfected roots and employed Brassica rapa and Brassica oleracea genomes as references for miRNA prediction and characterization. We identified 893 B. napus miRNAs representing 360 conserved and 533 novel miRNAs, and mapped 429 and 464 miRNAs to the AA and CC genomes, respectively. Microsynteny analysis with the conserved miRNAs and their flanking protein coding sequences revealed 137 AA-CC genome syntenic miRNA pairs and 61 AA and 42 CC genome-unique miRNAs. Sixty-two miRNAs were responsive to the V. longisporum infection. We present data for specific interactions and simultaneously reciprocal changes in the expression levels of the miRNAs and their targets in the infected roots. We demonstrate that miRNAs are involved in the plant-fungus interaction and that miRNA168-Argonaute 1 (AGO1) expression modulation might act as a key regulatory module in a compatible plant-V. longisporum interaction. Our results suggest that V. longisporum may have evolved a virulence mechanism by interference with plant miRNAs to reprogram plant gene expression and achieve infection.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Plant disease resistance (R) genes with the nucleotide binding site (NBS) play an important role in offering resistance to pathogens. The availability of complete genome sequences of Brassica oleracea and Brassica rapa provides an important opportunity for researchers to identify and characterize NBS-encoding R genes in Brassica species and to compare with analogues in Arabidopsis thaliana based on a comparative genomics approach. However, little is known about the evolutionary fate of NBS-encoding genes in the Brassica lineage after split from A. thaliana.
RESULTS: Here we present genome-wide analysis of NBS-encoding genes in B. oleracea, B. rapa and A. thaliana. Through the employment of HMM search and manual curation, we identified 157, 206 and 167 NBS-encoding genes in B. oleracea, B. rapa and A. thaliana genomes, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis among 3 species classified NBS-encoding genes into 6 subgroups. Tandem duplication and whole genome triplication (WGT) analyses revealed that after WGT of the Brassica ancestor, NBS-encoding homologous gene pairs on triplicated regions in Brassica ancestor were deleted or lost quickly, but NBS-encoding genes in Brassica species experienced species-specific gene amplification by tandem duplication after divergence of B. rapa and B. oleracea. Expression profiling of NBS-encoding orthologous gene pairs indicated the differential expression pattern of retained orthologous gene copies in B. oleracea and B. rapa. Furthermore, evolutionary analysis of CNL type NBS-encoding orthologous gene pairs among 3 species suggested that orthologous genes in B. rapa species have undergone stronger negative selection than those in B .oleracea species. But for TNL type, there are no significant differences in the orthologous gene pairs between the two species.
CONCLUSION: This study is first identification and characterization of NBS-encoding genes in B. rapa and B. oleracea based on whole genome sequences. Through tandem duplication and whole genome triplication analysis in B. oleracea, B. rapa and A. thaliana genomes, our study provides insight into the evolutionary history of NBS-encoding genes after divergence of A. thaliana and the Brassica lineage. These results together with expression pattern analysis of NBS-encoding orthologous genes provide useful resource for functional characterization of these genes and genetic improvement of relevant crops.},

	abstract = {The lack of resistant source has greatly restrained resistance breeding of rapeseed (Brassica napus, AACC) against Sclerotinia sclerotiorum which causes severe yield losses in rapeseed production all over the world. Recently, several wild Brassica oleracea accessions (CC) with high level of resistance have been identified (Mei et al. in Euphytica 177:393-400, 2011), bringing a new hope to improve Sclerotinia resistance of rapeseed. To map quantitative trait loci (QTL) for Sclerotinia resistance from wild B. oleracea, an F2 population consisting of 149 genotypes, with several clones of each genotypes, was developed from one F1 individual derived from the cross between a resistant accession of wild B. oleracea (B. incana) and a susceptible accession of cultivated B. oleracea var. alboglabra. The F2 population was evaluated for Sclerotinia reaction in 2009 and 2010 under controlled condition. Significant differences among genotypes and high heritability for leaf and stem reaction indicated that genetic components accounted for a large portion of the phenotypic variance. A total of 12 QTL for leaf resistance and six QTL for stem resistance were identified in 2 years, each explaining 2.2-28.4 \% of the phenotypic variation. The combined effect of alleles from wild B. oleracea reduced the relative susceptibility by 22.5 \% in leaves and 15 \% in stems on average over 2 years. A 12.8-cM genetic region on chromosome C09 of B. oleracea consisting of two major QTL intervals for both leaf and stem resistance was assigned into a 2.7-Mb genomic region on chromosome A09 of B. rapa, harboring about 30 putative resistance-related genes. Significant negative corrections were found between flowering time and relative susceptibility of leaf and stem. The association of flowering time with Sclerotinia resistance is discussed.},

	doi = {10.1186/1472-6750-12-10},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: To facilitate the screening of large quantities of new antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), we describe a cost-effective method for high throughput prokaryotic expression of AMPs. EDDIE, an autoproteolytic mutant of the N-terminal autoprotease, Npro, from classical swine fever virus, was selected as a fusion protein partner. The expression system was used for high-level expression of six antimicrobial peptides with different sizes: Bombinin-like peptide 7, Temporin G, hexapeptide, Combi-1, human Histatin 9, and human Histatin 6. These expressed AMPs were purified and evaluated for antimicrobial activity.
RESULTS: Two or four primers were used to synthesize each AMP gene in a single step PCR. Each synthetic gene was then cloned into the pET30a/His-EDDIE-GFP vector via an in vivo recombination strategy. Each AMP was then expressed as an Npro fusion protein in Escherichia coli. The expressed fusion proteins existed as inclusion bodies in the cytoplasm and the expression levels of the six AMPs reached up to 40\% of the total cell protein content. On in vitro refolding, the fusion AMPs was released from the C-terminal end of the autoprotease by self-cleavage, leaving AMPs with an authentic N terminus. The released fusion partner was easily purified by Ni-NTA chromatography. All recombinant AMPs displayed expected antimicrobial activity against E. coli, Micrococcus luteus and S. cerevisia.
CONCLUSIONS: The method described in this report allows the fast synthesis of genes that are optimized for over-expression in E. coli and for the production of sufficiently large amounts of peptides for functional and structural characterization. The Npro partner system, without the need for chemical or enzymatic removal of the fusion tag, is a low-cost, efficient way of producing AMPs for characterization. The cloning method, combined with bioinformatic analyses from genome and EST sequence data, will also be useful for screening new AMPs. Plasmid pET30a/His-EDDIE-GFP also provides green/white colony selection for high-throughput recombinant AMP cloning.},

A simple and direct method for the selection of high-producing clones can dramatically enhance the whole production process along with significant decrease in production costs.
RESULTS: A visual method for rapid selection of high-producing clones based on mannanase reporter system was developed. The study explained that it was possible to use mannanase activity as a measure of the expression level of the protein of interest. High-producing target protein clones were directly selected based on the size of hydrolysis holes in the selected plate. As an example, the target gene (9elp-hal18) was expressed and purified in Pichia pastoris using this technology.

In order to study the functions of plant hormones, it is necessary to develop a high-throughput and highly selective and sensitive method for determination of plant hormones.
OBJECTIVE: Based on SPE-HPLC-ESI-MS/MS method, a highly selective and sensitive method for determination of six plant hormones in leaf tissue of oilseed rape was developed.
METHODOLOGY: The extraction was performed with C₁₈ solid-phase extraction cartridge and the sample was subsequently analysed by HPLC-ESI-MS/MS. Methanol and H₂O with 0.05\% formic acid was selected as the mobile phase for HPLC, using a gradient of increasing methanol content. The plant hormones were quantified in MRM mode and identified in IDA mode by the hybrid triple quadrupole/linear ion trap mass spectrometer with high sensitivity and selectivity.
RESULTS: Under the optimal conditions, good linearities were obtained for six plant hormones with the correlation coefficients above 0.9924. The detection limits of the target compounds were in the range of 0.005-0.2 ng/mL. Reproducibility of the method was obtained with intra-day and inter-day relative standard deviations. The extraction recovery yields of plant hormones under SPE conditions ranged from 67.03 to 119.83\%.

The information about MJA levels in plant tissues is helpful for the study of the disease resistance mechanism and genetically engineered cultivars with increased resistance. Therefore, the quantification of MJA levels in plant tissues by means of a sensitive and reliable method is of interest.
OBJECTIVE: Development of a film extraction method coupled with GC for determination of methyl jasmonate in leaf tissue of oilseed rape for analysis of early signalling in sclerotinia sclerotiorum resistance.
METHODOLOGY: A robust polydimethylsiloxane film was prepared and used for extraction of MJA in leaf tissues. By using in-solution extraction mode, optimum extraction efficiency was achieved with methanol-water (1 : 5, v/v) as extraction medium at 40 degrees C for 60 min.
RESULTS: Under the optimal conditions, a detection limit of 0.2 ng/mL was achieved. Excellent reproducibility was found over a linear range of 1-1000 ng/mL. MJA in leaves infected by sclerotinia sclerotiorum was determined, with the results showing that basal levels of MJA (15 ng/g) were present in noninfested controls, but increased to 313 ng/g 10 h after fungal attack.
CONCLUSION: The film extraction method is a simple, rapid and inexpensive sampling technique for determination of endogenous MJA in plant tissues that can be applied to most plants.},

It is important to accurately and sensitively detect SA levels. A gold electrode modified with copper nanoparticles was used to assay the electrocatalytic oxidation of salicylic acid. It was found that the electrochemical behavior of salicylic acid was greatly improved at copper nanoparticles, indicating that anodic oxidation could be catalyzed at copper nanoparticles. And the pH had remarkable effect on the electrochemical process, a very well-defined oxidation peak appeared at pH 13.3 (0.2M NaOH). The kinetics parameters of this process were calculated and the heterogeneous electron transfer rate constant (k) was determined to be 1.34x10(-3)cms(-1), and (1-alpha)n(alpha) was 1.22. The gold electrode modified with copper nanoparticles could detect SA at a higher sensitivity than common electrodes. The electrode was used to detect the SA levels in oilseed rape infected with the fungal pathogen Sclerotinia sclerotiorum. The results showed that the SA concentration reached a maximum during the 10th-25th hours after infection. This result was very similar to that determined by HPLC, indicating that the gold electrodes modified with copper nanoparticles could be used as salicylic acid sensors.},

A rapid and simple technique was employed for in vivo detection of oxidative burst in oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.) leaves, using a modified electrode. Platinum (Pt) micro-particles were dispersed on a Pt electrode, coated with a poly (o-phenylenediamine) film. This exhibited high sensitivity, selectivity and stability in H(2)O(2) detection. Amperometry was used to obtain satisfactory linear relationships between reductive current intensities and H(2)O(2) concentrations at -0.1 V potential in different electrolytes. This electrode was used in vivo to detect oxidative burst in oilseed rape following fungal infection. Oxidative bursts induced by infection of the fungal pathogen Sclerotinia sclerotiorum (Lib.) de Bary exhibited notably different mechanisms between a susceptible and a resistant glucose oxidase-transgenic genotype.},

Studies on the Arabidopsis thaliana MPK4 loss-of-function mutant have implicated that AtMPK4 is involved in plant defense regulation, and its effect on disease resistance varies in different plant-pathogen interactions. In this study, we isolated a B. napus mitogen-activated protein kinase, BnMPK4, and found that BnMPK4 along with PDF1.2 are inducible in resistant line Zhongshuang9 but both are consistently suppressed in susceptible line 84039 after inoculation with S. sclerotiorum. Transgenic oilseed rape overexpressing BnMPK4 markedly enhances resistance to S. sclerotiorum and Botrytis cinerea. Further experiments showed that transgenic plants inhibited growth of S. sclerotiorum and constitutively activated PDF1.2 but decreased H2O2 production and constitutively suppressed PR-1 expression. Treatment of roots of the transgenic plants with H2O2 solution resulted in enhanced susceptibility to the two pathogens. Our results support the idea that MPK4 positively regulates jasmonic acid-mediated defense response, which might play an important role in resistance to S. sclerotiorum in oilseed rape.},

Oxalate oxidase (OXO) can oxidize OA into CO2 and H2O2. In this study, we show that transgenic oilseed rape (sixth generation lines) constitutively expressing wheat (Triticum aestivum) OXO displays considerably increased OXO activity and enhanced resistance to S. sclerotiorum (with up to 90.2 and 88.4\% disease reductions compared with the untransformed parent line and a resistant control, respectively). Upon application of exogenous OA, the pH values in transgenic plants were maintained at levels slightly lower than 5.58 measured prior to OA treatment, whereas the pH values in untransformed plants decreased rapidly and were markedly lower than 5.63 measured prior to OA treatment. Following pathogen inoculation, H2O2 levels were higher in transgenic plants than in untransformed plants. These results indicate that the enhanced resistance of the OXO transgenic oilseed rape to Sclerotinia is probably mediated by OA detoxification. We believe that enhancing the OA metabolism of oilseed rape in this way will be an effective strategy for improving resistance to S. sclerotiorum.},

	abstract = {We have been using a mutational approach to determine how plant-beneficial bacteria such as Enterobacter cloacae 501R3 obtain carbon and energy for colonization of subterranean portions of cucumber and other plants. Reduced carbon detected in cucumber root exudate consisted of 73.3 \% amino acids, 22.2 \% organic acids and 4.4 \% carbohydrate. Ent. cloacae M2, a mini-Tn5 Km transposon mutant of strain 501R3, was severely reduced in in vitro growth relative to strain 501R3 on the mixture of amino acids and organic acids detected in cucumber root exudate when these compounds were supplied as the sole source of carbon and energy, but was similar in growth on the mixture of carbohydrates detected in this exudate. Molecular and biochemical characterization of Ent. cloacae M2 indicated that the transposon was inserted in sdhA, which encodes a subunit of succinate dehydrogenase. Ent. cloacae A-11, a mutant of strain 501R3 with a mini-Tn5 Km insertion in pfkA, was severely reduced in in vitro growth relative to strain 501R3 on the mixture of carbohydrates detected in cucumber root exudate, but similar in growth on the mixture of amino acids and organic acids. When strains A-11 and M2 were coapplied with strain 501R3 to cucumber seeds above carrying capacity in competitive root colonization assays, populations of strains A-11 and M2 were roughly one order of magnitude lower than those of strain 501R3 in cucumber rhizosphere, while populations of strains A-11 and M2 were similar to one other when coapplied to cucumber seeds. When Ent. cloacae strains were coapplied to cucumber seeds below carrying capacity, populations of A-11 and M2 were roughly two to three orders of magnitude lower than those of 501R3 in cucumber rhizosphere, and populations of A-11 were significantly lower than those of M2 when these two strains were coapplied to cucumber seed. The experiments reported here indicate an important role for pfkA and sdhA and the catabolism of carbohydrates, and of amino acids and organic acids, respectively, in the colonization of cucumber roots by Ent. cloacae. The results reported here also indicate that catabolism of carbohydrates by this bacterium is more important than catabolism of amino acids and organic acids at lower population densities, despite the much higher relative quantities of amino acids and organic acids detected in cucumber root exudate.},

Oxalate oxidase (OXO) is an enzyme associated with the detoxification of OA, and hence the introduction of an OXO gene into oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.) to break down OA may be an alternative way of increasing the resistance of the plant to Sclerotinia sclerotiorum. In order to investigate the activation of OXO in transgenic oilseed rape, a convenient and accessible method was used to monitor changes in pH in response to stress induced by OA. The pH sensor, a platinum microcylinder electrode modified using polyaniline film, exhibited a linear response within the pH range from 3 to 7, with a Nernst response slope of 70 mV/pH at room temperature. The linear correlation coefficient was 0.9979. Changes induced by OA in the pH values of leaf tissue of different oilseed rape species from Brassica napus L. were monitored in real time in vivo using this electrode. The results clearly showed that the transgenic oilseed rape was more resistant to OA than non-transgenic oilseed rape.},

Our understanding of underlying genes and their interaction across environments in improving crop productivity is limited. A doubled haploid population was analysed to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with water-use efficiency (WUE) related traits. High WUE in the vegetative phase was associated with low seed yield. Based on the resequenced parental genome data, we developed sequence-capture-based markers and validated their linkage with carbon isotope discrimination (Δ13 C) in an F2 population. RNA sequencing was performed to determine the expression of candidate genes underlying Δ13 C QTL. QTL contributing to main and QTL × environment interaction effects for Δ13 C and yield were identified. One multiple-trait QTL for Δ13 C, days to flower, plant height, and seed yield was identified on chromosome A09. Interestingly, this QTL region overlapped with a homoeologous exchange (HE) event, suggesting its association with the multiple traits. Transcriptome analysis revealed 121 significantly differentially expressed genes underlying Δ13 C QTL on A09 and C09, including in HE regions. Sorting out the negative relationship between vegetative WUE and seed yield is a priority. Genetic and genomic resources and knowledge so developed could improve canola WUE and yield.},

Herein, the candidate genes association study, conducted on 324 genetically diverse rapeseed accessions, detected 114 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with ω-3 fatty acid. Furthermore, these loci were functionally characterized in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. These associated loci were selected based on their contribution to a high C18:3 ratio, and the selected candidate loci were validated using allele-specific SNPs markers in an inbred population through polymerase chain reaction (PCR). These findings may contribute to improving the fatty acid composition by marker-based breeding and will facilitate the development of rapeseed varieties with high ω-3 content.},

Low potassium efficiency leads to a high use of fertilizers, which is not only farmer unfriendly but also deteriorates the environment. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are widely used to dissect complex traits. However, most studies use single-locus one-dimensional GWAS models which do not provide true information about complex traits that are controlled by multiple loci. Here, both single-locus GWAS (MLM) and multi-locus GWAS (pLARmEB, FASTmrMLM, mrMLM, FASTmrEMMA) models were used with genotyping from 90 K Infinium SNP array and phenotype derived from four normal and potassium-stress environments, which identified 534 significant marker-trait associations (MTA) for agronomic and potassium related traits: pLARmEB = 279, FASTmrMLM = 213, mrMLM = 35, MLM = 6, FASTmrEMMA = 1. Further screening of these MTA led to the detection of eleven stable loci: q1A, q1D, q2B-1, q2B-2, q2D, q4D, q5B-1, q5B-2, q5B-3, q6D, and q7A. Moreover, Meta-QTL (MQTL) analysis of four independent QTL studies for potassium deficiency in bread wheat located 16 MQTL on 13 chromosomes. One locus identified in this study (q5B-1) colocalized with an MQTL (MQTL\_11 ), while the other ten loci were novel associations. Gene ontology of these loci identified 20 putative candidate genes encoding functional proteins involved in key pathways related to stress tolerance, sugar metabolism, and nutrient transport. These findings provide potential targets for breeding potassium stress resistant wheat cultivars and advocate the advantages of multi-locus GWAS models for studying complex traits.},

Oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.) is one of the candidate plants that can absorb the considerable quantity of toxic metals from the soil. Here, we used two cultivars of B. napus cvs. ZS 758 (metal-tolerant) and Zheda 622 (metal-susceptible) to investigate the phenological attributes, cell ultrastructure, protein kinases (PKs) and molecular transporters (MTs) under the combined treatments of Cr stress and reduced glutathione (GSH). Seeds of these cultivars were grown in vitro at different treatments i.e., 0, 400 μM Cr, and 400 μM Cr + 1 mM GSH in control growth chamber for 6 days. Results had confirmed that Cr significantly reduced the plant length, stem and root, and fresh biomass such as leaf, stem and root. Cr noticeably caused the damages in leaf mesophyll cells. Exogenous application of GSH significantly recovered both phenological and cell structural damages in two cultivars under Cr stress. For the PKs, transcriptomic data advocated that Cr stress alone significantly increased the gene expressions of BnaA08g16610D, BnaCnng19320D, and BnaA08g00390D over that seen in controls (Ck). These genes encoded both nucleic acid and transition metal ion binding proteins, and protein kinase activity (PKA) and phosphotransferase activities in both cultivars. Similarly, the presence of Cr revealed elite MT genes [BnaA04g26560D, BnaA02g28130D, and BnaA02g01980D (novel)] that were responsible for water transmembrane transporter activity. However, GSH in combination with Cr stress significantly up-regulated the genes for PKs [such as BnaCnng69940D (novel) and BnaC08g49360D] that were related to PKA, signal transduction, and oxidoreductase activities. For MTs, BnaC01g29930D and BnaA07g14320D were responsible for secondary active transmembrane transporter and protein transporter activities that were expressed more in GSH treatment than either Ck or Cr-treated cells. In general, it can be concluded that cultivar ZS 758 is more tolerant toward Cr-induced stress than Zheda 622.},

	abstract = {Iron toxicity is a nutrient disorder that severely affects crop development and yield in some soil conditions. Vacuolar detoxification of metal stress is an important strategy for plants to survive and adapt to this adverse environment. Vacuolar iron transporter (VIT) members are involved in this process and play essential roles in iron storage and transport. In this study, we identified a rapeseed VIT gene BnMEB2 (BnaC07g30170D) homologs to Arabidopsis MEB2 (At5g24290). Transient expression analysis revealed that BnMEB2 was localized to the vacuolar membrane. Q-PCR detection showed a high expression of BnMEB2 in mature (60-day-old) leaves and could be obviously induced by exogenous iron stress in both roots and leaves. Over-expressed BnMEB2 in both Arabidopsis wild type and meb2 mutant seedlings resulted in greatly improved iron tolerability with no significant changes in the expression level of other VIT genes. The mutant meb2 grew slowly and its root hair elongation was inhibited under high iron concentration condition while BnMEB2 over-expressed transgenic plants of the mutant restored the phenotypes with apparently higher iron storage in roots and dramatically increased iron content in the whole plant. Taken together, these results suggested that BnMEB2 was a VIT gene in rapeseed which was necessary for safe storage and vacuole detoxification function of excess iron to enhance the tolerance of iron toxicity. This research sheds light on a potentially new strategy for attenuating hazardous metal stress from environment and improving iron biofortification in Brassicaceae crops.},

	abstract = {The peanut plant produces flowers aerially, while develops the fruits and seeds underground. Pod swelling is a vital process of peanut pod and seed development only occurring after the gynophore carrying the ovule into the soil. The failure of gynophore penetration into the soil leads to suppression of pod swelling initiation. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the process remains unknown. A comparative proteome analysis between developing aerial and subterranean pods at various developmental stages was performed using 2-DE approach. 47 significantly differentially expressed spots were selected to further identification by MALDI-TOF-TOF MS. They were corresponded to 31 distinct proteins, suggesting that many identified spots were modified in post-translation. Functional annotation revealed their involvement in twelve important biological processes, such as photosynthesis, oxidative stress response, lignin synthesis, fatty acid biosynthesis, glycolysis, protein catabolic process, cellular metabolic process, regulation process, etc. Furthermore, 10 identified proteins were validated by real-time RT-PCR analysis. Several photosynthesis and oxidative stress proteins displayed elevated expression levels in aerial pods. Otherwise, enzymes in lignin synthesis and ubiquitin proteasome system were down-accumulation in subterranean pods. These enzymes might function as potential candidate proteins and play critical roles to regulate pods swelling and development.
BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Pod swelling plays a crucial role in peanut fruit and seed development. However, a large number of aerial pods can't form normal pods due to suppression of swelling initiation by the failure of penetration into the soil, thereby causing to seed yield loss. Limited knowledge is available underlying molecular mechanism regulating initiation of swelling in peg tips and pod development. The results generated in this study may provide evidence for some functional proteins as potential candidates to pod swelling and new molecular insights to improve our understanding of pod development under light and darkness conditions, which may contribute valuable information to high yield breeding in future.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The fertile and sterile plants were derived from the self-pollinated offspring of the F1 hybrid between the novel restorer line NR1 and the Nsa CMS line in Brassica napus. To elucidate gene expression and regulation caused by the A and C subgenomes of B. napus, as well as the alien chromosome and cytoplasm from Sinapis arvensis during the development of young floral buds, we performed a genome-wide high-throughput transcriptomic sequencing for young floral buds of sterile and fertile plants.
RESULTS: In this study, equal amounts of total RNAs taken from young floral buds of sterile and fertile plants were sequenced using the Illumina/Solexa platform. After filtered out low quality data, a total of 2,760,574 and 2,714,441 clean tags were remained in the two libraries, from which 242,163 (Ste) and 253,507 (Fer) distinct tags were obtained. All distinct sequencing tags were annotated using all possible CATG+17-nt sequences of the genome and transcriptome of Brassica rapa and those of Brassica oleracea as the reference sequences, respectively. In total, 3231 genes of B. rapa and 3371 genes of B. oleracea were detected with significant differential expression levels. GO and pathway-based analyses were performed to determine and further to understand the biological functions of those differentially expressed genes (DEGs). In addition, there were 1089 specially expressed unknown tags in Fer, which were neither mapped to B. oleracea nor to B. rapa, and these unique tags were presumed to arise basically from the added alien chromosome of S. arvensis. Fifteen genes were randomly selected and their expression levels were confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR, and fourteen of them showed consistent expression patterns with the digital gene expression (DGE) data.
CONCLUSIONS: A number of genes were differentially expressed between the young floral buds of sterile and fertile plants. Some of these genes may be candidates for future research on CMS in Nsa line, fertility restoration and improved agronomic traits in NR1 line. Further study of the unknown tags which were specifically expressed in Fer will help to explore desirable agronomic traits from wild species.},

The LP-tolerant genotype 102 maintained higher Pi concentrations than LP-sensitive genotype 105 when growing hydroponically under the 5-μM phosphorus condition. In 102 we observed the downregulation of the proteins related to gene transcription, protein translation, carbon metabolism, and energy transfer in leaves and roots, and the downregulation of proteins related to leaf growth and root cellular organization. But the proteins related to the formation of lateral root were upregulated, such as the auxin-responsive family proteins in roots and the sucrose-phosphate synthase-like protein in roots and leaves. On the other hand, the LP-sensitive genotype 105 maintained the low level of Pi concentrations and suffered high oxidative pressure under the LP condition, and stress-shocking proteins were pronouncedly upregulated such as the proteins for signal transduction, gene transcription, secondary metabolism, universal stress family proteins, as well as the proteins involved in lipid oxygenation and the disease resistance in both leaves and roots. Although the leaf proteins for growth in 105 were downregulated, the protein expressions in roots related to glycolysis and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle were enhanced to satisfy the requirement of organic acid secretion.},

	abstract = {Regulation of seed oil accumulation in oilseed rape (Brassica napus) has important economic significance. However, few genes have been characterized that affect final seed oil content. Through a mutant identification, the class IV homeodomain-ZIP transcription factor GLABRA2 (GL2) has been found to regulate seed oil accumulation in Arabidopsis, in addition to its role in trichome development. In this study, we isolated four distinct orthologues of GL2 from B. napus (AC-genome), B. rapa (A) and B. oleracea (C), using an overlapping-PCR strategy. The four GL2 orthologues were very similar, with 96.10-99.69\% identity in exon regions, 75.45-93.84\% in intron regions, 97.34-99.87\% in amino acid sequences. Alignments of the four genes revealed that the A-genome sequences of BnaA.GL2.a from B. napus and BraA.GL2.a from B. rapa are more similar than the others, and likewise the C-genome sequences of BnaC.GL2.b from B. napus and BolC.GL2.a from B. oleracea are more similar. BnaA.GL2.a and BraA.GL2.a from the A-genome are highly expressed in roots, whilst BnaC.GL2.b and BolC.GL2.a from the C-genome are preferentially expressed in seeds. Transgenic ectopic overexpression and suppression of BnaC.GL2.b in Arabidopsis allowed further investigation of the effect on seed oil content. Overexpression generated two phenotypes: the wild-type-like and the gl2-mutant-like (an Arabidopsis glabrous mutant of gl2-2), with increases in seed oil content of 3.5-5.0\% in the gl2-mutant-like transgenic plants. Suppression resulted in increases of 2.5-6.1\% in seed oil content, and reduced trichome number at the leaf margins. These results suggest that BnaC.GL2.b can negatively regulate oil accumulation in Arabidopsis seeds. As a result of comparing the four GL2 genes, three A/C-genome-specific primer sets were developed and a C-genome-specific EcoRV cleavage site was identified, which can be used as functional markers to distinguish these orthologues within Brassica species. The genes identified and their molecular markers developed in this study will be valuable both for oilseed rape breeding focusing on improvement of seed oil content, and for detecting gene flow between populations.},

The isolated 2,581 bp sequences from 220A (named 220A-gDNA, GenBank accession number AY288778), 220B (220B-gDNA, AY257490), 6A (6A-gDNA, DQ060318) and 6C (6C-gDNA, DQ060319) all contained six introns. Forty-one single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) sites were detected by alignment of these four sequences, seven of them dispersed in the exon regions. Two SNPs (1247, 1656) were detected between 220A-gDNA and 220B-gDNA, and the one at nucleotide 1247 of 220A-gDNA with A replaced by C was a missense mutation, which may be the putative male sterility site in 220A. All eight SNPs identified between 6A-gDNA and 6C-gDNA were located in the third intron, so the proteins encoded by them are the same. The one SNP between 6A-/6C-gDNA and 220A-/220B-gDNA at nucleotide 2474 of 220A-/220B-gDNA with C replaced by G was a missense mutation. Mutation site of BNMS2PROT (CAA68190.1) encoded by MS2Bnap in 220A(254) and 6A/6C(584) is different, which indicated dominant digenic male sterile line 220AB and 6CA have some difference in the molecular level.

	abstract = {Black rot caused by the vascular pathogenic bacterium Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris (Xcc) is widespread in Brassicaceae plants and an infectious disease that causes large yield losses in oil seed rape (Brassica napus L.). Improvement of resistance through breeding is a crucial strategy to prevent black rot disease in B. napus, but presently hampered by insufficient understanding of Xcc-Brassica interactions. This study compares two EMS-mutagenized B. napus lines that show contrasting resistance levels to their susceptible progenitor. Patterns of differential gene expression between these B. napus lines were evaluated at three time points post inoculation by comparative RNA-seq analysis. In line with the observed disease phenotypes, the susceptible line ZS9mXccS-1 displayed a steady amount of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) at different time points of infection, whereas the resistant line ZS9mXccR-1 displayed a gradual increase in DEGs throughout the course of infection. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) pinpointed multiple defense-related hub genes with potential central roles in immunity, including the cell surface receptor genes CRK11 and BIR1, and the associated downstream regulatory genes WRKY11 and PBL30. KEGG analysis of DEGs belonging to two distinct co-expression modules revealed enriched pathways associated with defense, including Ca2+-signalling, receptor-mediated immunity, and phytohormone balance. Taken together, our comparative transcriptome analysis provides new avenues to unravel the mechanisms underlying black rot resistance in B. napus.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: We recently characterized HAmo SINE and its partner LINE in silver carp and bighead carp based on hybridization capture of repetitive elements from digested genomic DNA in solution using a bead-probe 1. To reveal the distribution and evolutionary history of SINEs and LINEs in cyprinid genomes, we performed a multi-species search for HAmo SINE and its partner LINE using the bead-probe capture and internal-primer-SINE polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques.
RESULTS: Sixty-seven full-size and 125 internal-SINE sequences (as well as 34 full-size and 9 internal sequences previously reported in bighead carp and silver carp) from 17 species of the family Cyprinidae were aligned as well as 14 new isolated HAmoL2 sequences. Four subfamilies (type I, II, III and IV), which were divided based on diagnostic nucleotides in the tRNA-unrelated region, expanded preferentially within a certain lineage or within the whole family of Cyprinidae as multiple active source genes. The copy numbers of HAmo SINEs were estimated to vary from 104 to 106 in cyprinid genomes by quantitative RT-PCR. Over one hundred type IV members were identified and characterized in the primitive cyprinid Danio rerio genome but only tens of sequences were found to be similar with type I, II and III since the type IV was the oldest subfamily and its members dispersed in almost all investigated cyprinid fishes. For determining the taxonomic distribution of HAmo SINE, inter-primer SINE PCR was conducted in other non-cyprinid fishes, the results shows that HAmo SINE- related sequences may disperse in other families of order Cypriniforms but absent in other orders of bony fishes: Siluriformes, Polypteriformes, Lepidosteiformes, Acipenseriformes and Osteoglossiforms.
CONCLUSIONS: Depending on HAmo LINE2, multiple source genes (subfamilies) of HAmo SINE actively expanded and underwent retroposition in a certain lineage or within the whole family of Cyprinidae. From this perspective, HAmo SINE should provide useful phylogenetic makers for future analyses of the evolutionary relationships among species in the family Cyprinidae.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Short and long interspersed elements (SINEs and LINEs, respectively), two types of retroposons, are active in shaping the architecture of genomes and powerful tools for studies of phylogeny and population biology. Here we developed special protocol to apply biotin-streptavidin bead system into isolation of interspersed repeated sequences rapidly and efficiently, in which SINEs and LINEs were captured directly from digested genomic DNA by hybridization to bead-probe complex in solution instead of traditional strategy including genomic library construction and screening.
RESULTS: A new couple of SINEs and LINEs that shared an almost identical 3'tail was isolated and characterized in silver carp and bighead carp of two closely related species. These SINEs (34 members), designated HAmo SINE family, were little divergent in sequence and flanked by obvious TSD indicated that HAmo SINE was very young family. The copy numbers of this family was estimated to 2 x 105 and 1.7 x 105 per haploid genome by Real-Time qPCR, respectively. The LINEs, identified as the homologs of LINE2 in other fishes, had a conserved primary sequence and secondary structures of the 3'tail region that was almost identical to that of HAmo SINE. These evidences suggest that HAmo SINEs are active and amplified recently utilizing the enzymatic machinery for retroposition of HAmoL2 through the recognition of higher-order structures of the conserved 42-tail region. We analyzed the possible structures of HAmo SINE that lead to successful amplification in genome and then deduced that HAmo SINE, SmaI SINE and FokI SINE that were similar in sequence each other, were probably generated independently and created by LINE family within the same lineage of a LINE phylogeny in the genomes of different hosts.
CONCLUSION: The presented results show the advantage of the novel method for retroposons isolation and a pair of young SINE family and its partner LINE family in two carp fishes, which strengthened the hypotheses containing the slippage model for initiation of reverse transcription, retropositional parasitism of SINEs on LINEs, the formation of the stem loop structure in 3'tail region of some SINEs and LINEs and the mechanism of template switching in generating new SINE family.},

	abstract = {Plant genome polyploidization and subsequent evolution is a crucial process for trait innovation and new species formation. Recurrent whole-genome duplication (WGD) existing in Brassica napus created abundant genetic variation, which make it an ideal model for studying the patterns and mechanism of polyploid genome evolution. Based on the availability of reference genomes and high-throughput ‘omics’ data, the duplicated genes derived from different WGD events were identified, enabling investigation of their expression divergence and epigenetic regulation. This chapter introduced generation and loss of duplicated genes in multiple cycles of whole-genome duplication and described expression divergence of duplicates, particularly those homeologous genes. Alternative splicing events may play an important role in expression divergence of the duplicate genes. Expression divergence of duplicated genes may be regulated by epigenetic mechanisms, especially subgenome interaction-related small RNA produced from transposable elements in the case that the two subgenomes have asymmetrical transposable elements and their abundance. In the future, the new ‘omics’ technologies could be used to accurately quantify expression divergence and its regulatory mechanisms of duplicated genes in relation to phenotypic changes to uncover polyploid genome evolution.},

Based on intraspecies syntenic analysis and comparison with B. rapa, the asymmetrical evolution of polyploid Brassica genomes were elucidated at the DNA, RNA, and epigenetic levels. Main features include asymmetrical gene loss in chromosomal blocks derived from whole-genome triplication (WGT), asymmetrical sequence, and expression divergence among WGT-derived duplicated genes, asymmetrical 24-nt sRNA regulated subgenome expression dominance, asymmetrical TE (transposable elements) accumulation, gene expansion between two Brassica genomes, and asymmetrical contribution to the novelty of agronomic traits between the different subgenomes. It was found that the multilayered asymmetrical evolution is also observed in ancient polyploids such as Arabidopsis, maize, grape, soybean, grasses as well as recent allopolyploids such as rapeseed, cotton, and wheat. These evidences support the role of asymmetrical evolution in the evolutionary success of polyploidy as well as their phenotypic novelty and adaptation. Further understanding of the mechanism of asymmetrical evolution of polyploid genomes lays a foundation for genetic breeding and enhancement of elite cultivars.},

They were located on A02 chromosome. Compared to QTL linkage analysis,the markers（Bn-A02-p9599263 and Bn-scaff157943-p62430） respectively located on the peak of QTL q PH2-2 and q PH2-4. Markers Bn-A02-p9636219 and Bn-A02-p9993945 were located in 2-LOD（log of the likehood odds ration） confidence interval for QTLs q PH2-3 and q PH2-4. Bn-A02-p9409799 was found near distance of 0. 3 c M confidence interval QTL（q PH2-2）. The interval range of QTL by genome-wide association studies（69. 5-80. 7 c M） was 24 c M shorter than that by QTL linkage analysis（60. 7-95. 9 c M）. According to the reference genome annotation information,a candidate gene（GSBRNA2T00-090973001） corresponding to the significant SNP（Bn-scaff157943-p62430） was predicted,locating in 2 kb away from the SNP. These results indicated that using single RIL population for gene-wide association studies not only compensated QTL’s linkage results,but also provided theoretical basis for fine mapping and gene cloning.},

	abstract = {A diallel mating design following Griffing’s method Ⅳ with six parents was employed for genetic analysis of resistance to Sclerotinia sclerotiorum and its toxin oxalic acid（OA）.These parents with a wide range of levels of resistance were bred during last fifteen years.Resistance was identified by methods of green- house disease nursery and seedlings fed oxalate through roots,which identified resistance to S.sclerotiorum and OA,respectively.The program used for genetic analysis was based on a model of the additive-dominance proposed by Zhu and Weir.Significant（P{\textless}0.01）additive and dominant variances were detected for disease index from both methods.The additive variance of resistance to S.sclerotiorum identified in the nursery was larger than the dominant variance.Contrarily,the additive variance of resistance to toxin was lower than the dominant variance.Heritability was estimated from disease index.Significant（P{\textless}0.01）narrow and broad heritabilities of resistance to the fungus infection were 0.403 and 0.750,respectively,and significant（P{\textless} 0.05）narrow and broad heritabilities of resistance to OA were 0.236 and 0.576,respectively.The results suggested that selection for resistance would generally be effective.Genetic effects in resistant and susceptible parents were different.Additive effects were generally negative （toward reducing disease） in resistant parents and positive in susceptible parents,suggesting resistant parents like 783-3 should be used for resistance breed- ing.Dominant effects in crosses between resistant and susceptible parents were either negative or positive de- pending on specific crosses and thus resistance of such crosses should be evaluated by experiments rather than prediction based on parents.},

of the main factors inducing the difference in genome size. However, the expressions of TEs and the TE effects on gene regulation and functions of these two Brassica diploid species were unclear. Here, we analyzed the RNA sequencing data of
leaves, roots, and stems from B. rapa and B. oleracea. Our data showed that overall TEs in either genome expressed at very
low levels, and the expression levels of different TE categories and families varied among different organs. Moreover, even
for the same TE category or family, the expression activities were distinct between the two Brassica diploids. Forty-one and
nine LTR retrotransposons with the transcripts that read into their adjacent sequences have the distances shorter than 2 kb
and 100 bp compared to the downstream genes. These LTR retrotransposon readout transcriptions may produce sense or
antisense transcripts of nearby genes, with the effects on activating or silencing corresponding genes. Meanwhile, intact
LTRs were detected at stronger readout activities than solo LTRs. Of the TEs inserted into genes, the frequencies were ob-
served at a higher level in B. rapa than in B. oleracea. In addition, DNA transposons were prone to insert or retain in the
intronic regions of genes in either Brassica genomes. These results revealed that the TEs may have potential effects on
regulating protein coding genes.},

Disease resistance identification showed that Rs transgenic plants had higher resistance to S. Sclerotiorum than non- transgenic plants. This study showed that the presence of high amount of antimicrobial peptide Rs in extracellular matrix could reduce cytotoxicity and enhance resistance of plants to S. sclerotiorum by significantly inhibiting extension of fungal hyphae.},
