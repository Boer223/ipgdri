	abstract = {Plants have evolved a series of strategies to combat pathogen infection. Plant SnRK1 is probably involved in shifting carbon and energy use from growth-associated processes to survival and defence upon pathogen attack, enhancing the resistance to many plant pathogens. The present study demonstrated that SnRK1.1 enhanced the resistance of Arabidopsis thaliana to clubroot disease caused by the plant-pathogenic protozoan Plasmodiophora brassicae. Through a yeast two-hybrid assay, glutathione S-transferase pull-down assay, and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assay, a P. brassicae RxLR effector, PBZF1, was shown to interact with SnRK1.1. Further expression level analysis of SnRK1.1-regulated genes showed that PBZF1 inhibited the biological function of SnRK1.1 as indicated by the disequilibration of the expression level of SnRK1.1-regulated genes in heterogeneous PBZF1-expressing A. thaliana. Moreover, heterogeneous expression of PBZF1 in A. thaliana promoted plant susceptibility to clubroot disease. In addition, PBZF1 was found to be P. brassicae-specific and conserved. This gene was significantly highly expressed in resting spores. Taken together, our results provide new insights into how the plant-pathogenic protist P. brassicae employs an effector to overcome plant resistance, and they offer new insights into the genetic improvement of plant resistance against clubroot disease.},

	abstract = {Glucosinolate (GSL) is associated with clubroot disease, which is caused by the obligate biotrophic protist Plasmodiophora brassicae. Due to the complicated composition of GSLs, their exact role in clubroot disease development remains unclear. By investigating clubroot disease resistance in cruciferous plants and characterizing the GSL content in seeds, we can determine if clubroot disease development is related to the components of GSLs. The difference in the infection process between Matthiola incana L. (resistant) and Brassica napus L. (susceptible) was determined. Root hair infection was definitely observed in both resistant and susceptible hosts, but no infection was observed during the cortical infection stage in resistant roots; this finding was verified by molecular detection of P. brassicae via PCR amplification at various times after inoculation. Based on the time course detection of the contents and compositions of GSLs after P. brassicae inoculation, susceptible roots exhibited increased accumulation of aliphatic, indolic, and aromatic GSLs in B. napus, but only aromatic GSLs were significantly increased in M. incana. Gluconapin, which was the main aliphatic GSL in B. napus and present only in B. napus, was significantly increased during the secondary infection stage. Quantification of the internal jasmonic acid (JA) concentration showed that both resistant and susceptible plants exhibited an enhanced level of JA, particularly in susceptible roots. The exogenous JA treatment induced aliphatic GSLs in B. napus and aromatic GSLs in M. incana. JA-induced aromatic GSLs may be involved in the defense against P. brassicae, whereas aliphatic GSLs induced by JA in B. napus likely play a role during the secondary infection stage. Three candidate MYB28 genes regulate the content of aliphatic GSLs identified in B. napus; one such gene was BnMYB28.1, which was significantly increased following both the treatment with exogenous JA and P. brassicae inoculation. In summary, the increased content of JA during the secondary infection stage may induce the expression of BnMYB28.1, which caused the accumulation of aliphatic GSLs in clubroot disease development.},

	abstract = {Clubroot caused by Plasmodiophora brassicae is an increasingly important soilborne disease in China. The host range of P. brassicae was investigated with 30 cruciferous plants, including 16 crop species, 9 ornamentals, and 5 weeds in field and pot-cultured conditions. In the field, 17 species from five genera produced visible galls, and these included radish, Capsella bursa-pastoris, Orychophragmus violaceus, Sinapis alba, and 13 Brassica crops. In pot-cultured conditions, an additional 13 plant species (11 genera) were determined to be hosts of P. brassicae. Five common weeds were found to be hosts of P. brassicae, including C. bursa-pastoris, Lepidium apetalum, Descurainia sophia, S. alba, and Thellungiella salsuginea. The infection of these plants was confirmed via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with primers specific to P. brassicae. No galls were found on Matthiola incana roots in the field or in pots and no resting spores of P. brassicae were observed in M. incana roots, although P. brassicae was detected in M. incana roots via PCR. Microscopic examination revealed infection only in the root hairs of M. incana roots. These results suggested that M. incana was highly resistant to P. brassicae in China and could be developed as a bait crop. In total, 297 accessions of oilseed rape were tested in the field, and 3 accessions of Brassica napus and 1 accession of B. juncea were found to be highly resistant to clubroot disease. These resistant resources provide options for managing clubroot in P. brassicae-infested fields.},

	abstract = {This study examined the role of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) during the early stage of infection of rapeseed (Brassica napus L.) by the obligate biotrophic protist Plasmodiophora brassicae Woron., which causes clubroot disease. Treatment of infected B. napus seedlings with exogenous IAA promoted the development of clubroot disease, including an increase in the number and size of galls, whereas treatment with N-1-naphthylphthalamic acid (NPA) attenuated the disease and altered the location and size of the root nodules, resulting in a reduced disease index. An increased level of free IAA was detected in the roots at 3 and 7 days after inoculation (DAI) compared with the control, suggesting the activation of IAA signaling in the early stage of P. brassicae infection. Moreover, IAA treatment caused no significant change in the germination rate of the resting spores but resulted in enhanced root hair infection. RT–PCR and quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) were used to analyze the expression of IAA homeostasis-related genes (3, 7, and 10 DAI) to identify gene expression patterns in the roots and leaves of B. napus after inoculation. Five IAA biosynthesis-related genes examined in this study were induced in the roots after inoculation with P. brassicae but not in the leaves. The rapid induction of BnAAO4 expression at 3 DAI may be responsible for the overproduction of IAA during the early stages of infection. This study suggests that IAA acts as a signaling molecule that putatively stimulates root hair infection in the early response of B. napus to P. brassicae infection.},

	abstract = {Shepherd's purse (Capsella bursa-pastoris (L.) Medicus) is an edible and wild medicinal plant widely distributed in China. This plant has been cultivated in Shanghai, China, since the end of the 19th century. Infection of C. bursa-pastoris by Plasmodiophora brassicae, the causal agent of clubroot disease on Brassica spp. has been reported in Korea (2), but is not known to occur in China. In February of 2011, stunted and wilted shepherd's purse (SP) plants were observed in a field planted to oilseed rapes (B. napus) in Sichuan Province of China. Symptomatic SP plants also exhibited root galls. Disease incidence was 6.2\% and 100\% for SP and B. napus, respectively. Root galls on diseased SP plants were collected for pathogen identification. Many resting spores were observed when the root galls were examined under a light microscope. The resting spores were circular in shape, measuring 2.0 to 3.1 μm in diameter (average 2.6 μm). PCR amplification was conducted to confirm the pathogen. DNA was extracted from root galls and healthy roots (control) of SP. Two primers, TC2F (5'-AAACAACGAGTCAGCTTGAATGCTAGTGTG-3') and TC2R (5'-CTTTAGTTGTGTTTCGGCTAGGATGGTTCG-3') were used to detect P. brassicae (1). No PCR amplifications were observed with the control DNA as template. A fragment of the expected size (approximately 520 bp) was obtained when DNA was amplified from diseased roots of SP. These results suggest that the pathogen in the galled roots of SP is P. brassicae. Pathogenicity of P. brassicae in SP was tested on plants of both SP and Chinese cabbage (CC) (B. campestris ssp. pekinensis). A resting spore suspension prepared from naturally infected SP roots was mixed with a sterilized soil in two plastic pots, resulting in a final concentration of 5 × 106 spores/g soil. Soil treated with the same volume of sterile water was used as a control. Seeds of SP and CC were pre-germinated on moist filter paper for 2 days (20°C) and seeded into the infested and control pots, one seed per pot for planted for CC and four seeds per pot for SP. The pots were placed in a chamber at 15 to 25°C under 12 h light and 12 h dark. Plants in each pot were uprooted after 4 weeks and the roots of each plant were washed under tap water and rated for clubroot disease. No disease symptoms were observed in the control treatments of SP or CC. Plants of both species showed symptoms of clubroot, with the disease incidence of 62.5\% and 100\% on SP and CC, respectively. The pathogen was isolated from diseased roots of each plant and confirmed as P. brassicae based on morphological characteristics and PCR detection. To our knowledge, this is the first report of clubroot disease on C. bursa-pastoris in Sichuan Province of China. This finding suggests that it may be necessary to manage C. bursa-pastoris in cruciferous vegetable (cabbage, turnip) and oilseed rape production fields. References: (1) T. Cao et al.

	abstract = {In plants, phloem is not only a vital structure that is used for nutrient transportation, but it is also the location of a response that defends against various stresses, named phloem-based defense (PBD). Phloem proteins (PP2s) are among the predominant proteins in phloem, indicating their potential functional role in PBD. Sclerotinia disease (SD), which is caused by the necrotrophic fungal pathogen S. sclerotiorum (Sclerotinia sclerotiorum), is a devastating disease that affects oil crops, especially Brassica napus (B. napus), mainly by blocking nutrition and water transportation through xylem and phloem. Presently, the role of PP2s in SD resistance is still largely estimated. Therefore, in this study, we identified 62 members of the PP2 gene family in the B. napus genome with an uneven distribution across the 19 chromosomes. A phylogenetic analysis classified the BnPP2s into four clusters (I-IV), with cluster I containing the most members (28 genes) as a consequence of its frequent genome segmental duplication. A comparison of the gene structures and conserved motifs suggested that BnPP2 genes were well conserved in clusters II to IV, but were variable in cluster I. Interestingly, the motifs in different clusters displayed unique features, such as motif 6 specifically existing in cluster III and motif 1 being excluded from cluster IV. These results indicated the possible functional specification of BnPP2s. A transcriptome data analysis showed that the genes in clusters II to IV exhibited dynamic expression alternation in tissues and the stimulation of S. sclerotiorum, suggesting that they could participate in SD resistance. A GWAS analysis of a rapeseed population comprising 324 accessions identified four BnPP2 genes that were potentially responsible for SD resistance and a transgenic study that was conducted by transiently expressing BnPP2-6 in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) leaves validated their positive role in regulating SD resistance in terms of reduced lesion size after inoculation with S. sclerotiorum hyphal plugs. This study provides useful information on PP2 gene functions in B. napus and could aid elaborated functional studies on the PP2 gene family.},

	abstract = {As one of the largest classes of lectins, legume lectins have a variety of desirable features such as antibacterial and insecticidal activities as well as anti-abiotic stress ability. The Sclerotinia disease (SD) caused by the soil-borne fungus Sclerotinia sclerotiorum is a devastating disease affecting most oil crops such as Brassica napus. Here, we identified 130 legume lectin (LegLu) genes in B. napus, which could be phylogenetically classified into seven clusters. The BnLegLu gene family has been significantly expanded since the whole-genome duplication (WGD) or segmental duplication. Gene structure and conserved motif analysis suggested that the BnLegLu genes were well conserved in each cluster. Moreover, relative to those genes only containing the legume lectin domain in cluster VI–VII, the genes in cluster I–V harbored a transmembrane domain and a kinase domain linked to the legume lectin domain in the C terminus. The expression of most BnLegLu genes was relatively low in various tissues. Thirty-five BnLegLu genes were responsive to abiotic stress, and 40 BnLegLu genes were strongly induced by S. sclerotiorum, with a most significant up-regulation of 715-fold, indicating their functional roles in SD resistance. Four BnLegLu genes were located in the candidate regions of genome-wide association analysis (GWAS) results which resulted from a worldwide rapeseed population consisting of 324 accessions associated with SD. Among them, the positive role of BnLegLus-16 in SD resistance was validated by transient expression in tobacco leaves. This study provides important information on BnLegLu genes, particularly about their roles in SD resistance, which may help targeted functional research and genetic improvement in the breeding of B. napus.},

The growing demand for oilseeds has necessitated the development of rapeseed varieties with improved quality. Therefore, a clear understanding of the genetic basis underlying the seed oil content (SOC) is required. In this study, a natural population comprising 204 diverse accessions and recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from Brassica napus and Sinapis alba via distant hybridization were collected for genome-wide association analysis (GWAS) and quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping of the SOC trait, respectively. The variable coefficient of the RIL and natural populations ranged from 7.43 to 10.43\% and 8.40 to 10.91\%. Then, a high-density linkage map was constructed based on whole genome re-sequencing (WGS); the map harbored 2,799 bin markers and covered a total distance of 1,835.21 cM, with an average marker interval of 0.66 cM. The QTLs for SOC on chromosome A07 were stably detected in both single and multiple environments. Finally, a novel locus qA07.SOC was identified as the major QTL for SOC based on the GWAS and RIL populations. In addition, the RNA-seq results showed that photosynthesis, lipid biosynthesis proteins, fatty acid metabolism, and unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis were significantly different between the developed seeds of the two parents of the RIL population. By comparing the variation information and expression levels of the syntenic genes within qA07.SOC and its syntenic genomic regions, as well as through haplotype analysis via GWAS, BnaA07.STR18, BnaA07.NRT1, and BnaA07g12880D were predicted as candidate genes in the qA07.SOC interval.

In each subfamily, the genes showed relatively conserved structures and motifs, but displayed distinct expression patterns in different tissues and under abiotic stress, which might be caused by the varied cis-acting regulatory elements among them. Transcriptome datasets from Pacbio/Illumina platforms showed that alternative splicing of SR genes was widespread in B. napus and the majority of paralogous gene pairs displayed different splicing patterns. Protein-protein interaction analysis indicated that SR proteins were involved in the regulation of the whole lifecycle of mRNA, from synthesis to decay. Moreover, the association mapping analysis suggested that 12 SR genes were candidate genes for regulating specific agronomic traits, which indicated that SR genes could affect the development and hence influence the important agronomic traits of B. napus.

Therefore, in this study, we performed genome-wide analysis to identify the ARI gene family and explore their potential importance in B. napus. A total of 39 ARI genes were identified in the B. napus genome and were classified into three subfamilies (A, B and C) based on phylogenetic analysis. The protein-protein interaction networks and enrichment analysis indicated that BnARI genes could be involved in endoreduplication, DNA repair, proteasome assembly, ubiquitination, protein kinase activity and stress adaptation. The transcriptome data analysis in various tissues provided us an indication of some BnARI genes' functional importance in tissue development. We also identified potential BnARI genes that were significantly responsive towards the abiotic stresses. Furthermore, eight BnARI genes were identified as candidate genes for multiple agronomic traits through association mapping analysis in B. napus; among them, BnaA02g12100D, which is the ortholog of AtARI8, was significantly associated with ten agronomic traits.

	abstract = {SET domain group encoding proteins function as histone lysine methyltransferases. These proteins are involved in various biological processes, including plant development and adaption to the environment by modifying the chromatin structures. So far, the SET domain genes (SDGs) have not been systematically investigated in Brassica napus (B. napus). In the current study, through genome-wide analysis, a total of 122 SDGs were identified in the B. napus genome. These BnSDGs were subdivided into seven (I-VII) classes based on phylogeny analysis, domain configurations, and motif distribution. Segmental duplication was involved in the evolution of this family, and the duplicated genes were under strong purifying selection. The promoter sequence of BnSDGs consisted of various growth, hormones, and stress-related cis-acting elements along with transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) for 20 TF families in 59 of the 122 BnSDGs. The gene ontology (GO) analysis revealed that BnSDGs were closely associated with histone and non-histone methylation and metal binding capacity localized mostly in the nucleus. The in silico expression analysis at four developmental stages in leaf, stem root, floral organ, silique, and seed tissues showed a broad range of tissue and stage-specific expression pattern. The expression analysis under four abiotic stresses (dehydration, cold, ABA, and salinity) also provided evidence for the importance of BnSDGs in stress environments. Based on expression analysis, we performed reverse transcription-quantitative PCR for 15 target BnSDGs in eight tissues (young leaf, mature leaf, root, stem, carpel, stamen, sepal, and petals). Our results were in accordance with the in silico expression data, suggesting the importance of these genes in plant development. In conclusion, this study lays a foundation for future functional studies on SDGs in B. napus.},

	abstract = {Cupin\_1 domain-containing proteins (CDPs) are ubiquitously present in higher plants, which are known to play essential roles in various biological processes. In this study, we carried out genome-wide characterization and systematic investigation of the CDP genes in Brassica napus. A total of 96 BnCDPs, including 71 germin-like proteins (GLPs; proteins with a single cupin\_1 domain) and 25 CDP bicupins (proteins with two cupin\_1 domains), were identified and clustered into six distinct subfamilies (I–VI) based on the phylogenic analysis, gene structure and motif distribution. Further analysis indicated that whole-genome duplication (WGD) and segmental duplication are main contributors to the species-specific expansion of the BnCDP gene family, and all the duplicated genes subsequently underwent strong purification selection. The promoter region of BnCDPs showed enrichment of cis-regulatory elements associated with development, hormone and stress, as well as transcription factor binding sites, which validates the prediction that BnCDPs are widely involved in plant growth and biotic and abiotic stress responses. The BnCDPs in different subfamilies exhibited obvious differences in expression among 30 developmental tissues/stages of B. napus, implying that BnCDPs may be involved in tissue- and stage-specific developmental processes. Similar trends in expression of most BnCDPs were observed under Sclerotinia sclerotiorum inoculation and four abiotic stresses (dehydration, cold, ABA and salinity), particularly the BnGLPs in subfamily I and III with single cupin\_1 domain, revealing that BnCDPs are of great importance in the environmental adaption of B. napus. We then performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 274 B. napus core germplasms on S. sclerotiorum resistance and identified four significantly associated loci harboring five BnGLPs. The expression levels of two candidate genes, BnGLP1.A08 and BnGLP1.C08, were significantly correlated with S. sclerotiorum resistance. Their functional responses to multiple stages of S. sclerotiorum inoculation and four abiotic stresses were further examined through qPCR. Overall, this study provides rich resources for research on the function and evolutionary playground of CDP genes.},

	abstract = {Traits related to flowering time are the most promising agronomic traits that directly impact the seed yield and oil quality of rapeseed (Brassica napus L.). Developing early flowering and maturity rapeseed varieties is an important breeding objective in B. napus. Many studies have reported on days to flowering, but few have reported on budding, bolting, and the interval between bolting and DTF. Therefore, elucidating the genetic architecture of QTLs and genes regulating flowering time, we presented an integrated investigation on SNP and haplotype-based genome-wide association study of 373 diverse B. napus germplasm, which were genotyped by the 60K SNP array and were phenotyped in the four environments. The results showed that a total of 15 and 37 QTLs were detected from SNP and haplotype-based GWAS, respectively. Among them, seven QTL clusters were identified by haplotype-based GWAS. Moreover, three and eight environmentally stable QTLs were detected by SNP-GWAS and haplotype-based GWAS, respectively. By integrating the above two approaches and by co-localizing the four traits, ten (10) genomic regions were under selection on chromosomes A03, A07, A08, A10, C06, C07, and C08. Interestingly, the genomic regions FT.A07.1, FT.A08, FT.C06, and FT.C07 were identified as novel. In these ten regions, a total of 197 genes controlling FT were detected, of which 14 highly expressed DEGs were orthologous to 13 Arabidopsis thaliana genes after integration with transcriptome results. In a nutshell, the above results uncovered the genetic architecture of important agronomic traits related to flowering time and provided a basis for multiple molecular marker-trait associations in B. napus.},

	abstract = {Plant height is a crucial element related to plant architecture that influences the seed yield of oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.). In this study, we isolated a natural B. napus mutant, namely a semi-dwarf mutant (sdw-e), which exhibits a 30\% reduction in plant height compared to Zhongshuang 11-HP (ZS11-HP). Quantitative trait locus sequencing (QTL-seq) was conducted using two extreme DNA bulks in F2 populations in Wuchang-2017 derived from ZS11-HP × sdw-e to identify QTLs associated with plant height. The result suggested that two QTL intervals were located on chromosome A10. The F2 population consisting of 200 individuals in Yangluo-2018 derived from ZS11-HP × sdw-e was used to construct a high-density linkage map using whole-genome resequencing. The high-density linkage map harbored 4323 bin markers and covered a total distance of 2026.52 cM with an average marker interval of 0.47 cM. The major QTL for plant height named qPHA10 was identified on linkage group A10 by interval mapping (IM) and composite interval mapping (CIM) methods. The major QTL qPHA10 was highly consistent with the QTL-seq results. And then, we integrated the variation sites and expression levels of genes in the major QTL interval to predict the candidate genes. Thus, the identified QTL and candidate genes could be used in marker-assisted selection for B. napus breeding in the future.},

We mapped yvl locus to a 70-kb interval between molecular markers yvl-O10 and InDel-O6 on chromosome A03 in BC2F2 population using whole genome re-sequencing and bulked segregant analysis. The mutant had a 'C' to 'T' substitution in the coding sequence of BnaA03.CHLH, which encodes putative H subunit of Mg-protoporphyrin IX chelatase (CHLH). The mutation resulted in an imperfect protein structure and reduced activity of CHLH. It also hampered the plastid encoded RNA polymerase which transcribes regulatory genes of photosystem II and I. Consequently, the chlorophyll a/b and carotenoid contents were reduced and the chloroplast ultrastructure was degraded in yvl mutant. These results explain that a single nucleotide mutation in BnaA03.CHLH impairs PEP activity to disrupt chloroplast development and chlorophyll biosynthesis in B. napus.},

	abstract = {Tung tree (Vernicia fordii) is an economically important woody oil plant that produces tung oil rich in eleostearic acid. Here, we report a high-quality chromosome-scale genome sequence of tung tree. The genome sequence was assembled by combining Illumina short reads, Pacific Biosciences single-molecule real-time long reads, and Hi-C sequencing data. The size of tung tree genome is 1.12 Gb, with 28,422 predicted genes and over 73\% repeat sequences. The V. fordii underwent an ancient genome triplication event shared by core eudicots but no further whole-genome duplication in the subsequent ca. 34.55 million years of evolutionary history of the tung tree lineage. Insertion time analysis revealed that repeat-driven genome expansion might have arisen as a result of long-standing long terminal repeat retrotransposon bursts and lack of efficient DNA deletion mechanisms. The genome harbors 88 resistance genes encoding nucleotide-binding sites; 17 of these genes may be involved in early-infection stage of Fusarium wilt resistance. Further, 651 oil-related genes were identified, 88 of which are predicted to be directly involved in tung oil biosynthesis. Relatively few phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase genes, and synergistic effects between transcription factors and oil biosynthesis-related genes might contribute to the high oil content of tung seed. The tung tree genome constitutes a valuable resource for understanding genome evolution, as well as for molecular breeding and genetic improvements for oil production.},

The relationship between Microcystis and the associated bacteria was investigated by a metagenomic approach in this study. We developed a visualization-guided method of binning for genome assembly after total colony DNA sequencing. We found that the method was effective in grouping sequences and it did not require reference genome sequence. Individual genomes of the colony bacteria were obtained and they provided valuable insights into microbial community structures. Analysis of metabolic pathways based on these genomes revealed that while all heterotrophic bacteria were dependent upon Microcystis for carbon and energy, Vitamin B12 biosynthesis, which is required for growth by Microcystis, was accomplished in a cooperative fashion among the bacteria. Our analysis also suggests that individual bacteria in the colony community contributed a complete pathway for degradation of benzoate, which is inhibitory to the cyanobacterial growth, and its ecological implication for Microcystis bloom is discussed.},

Although yellowish flower color is a common variant observed in field-grown oilseed rape, the genetics behind this variation remains unclear. We obtained a yellowish-white flower (ywf) mutant from Zhongshuang 9 (ZS9) by ethyl methanesulfonate mutagenesis (EMS) treatment. Compared with ZS9, ywf exhibited a lower carotenoid content with a reduced and defective chromoplast ultrastructure in the petals. Genetic analysis revealed that the yellowish-white trait was controlled by a single recessive gene. Using bulked-segregant analysis sequencing (BSA-seq) and kompetitive allele-specific PCR (KASP), we performed map-based cloning of the ywf locus on chromosome A08 and found that ywf harbored a C-to-T substitution in the coding region, resulting in a premature translation termination. YWF, encoding phytoene desaturase 3 (PDS3), was highly expressed in oilseed rape petals and involved in carotenoid biosynthesis. Pathway enrichment analysis of the transcriptome profiles from ZS9 and ywf indicated the carotenoid biosynthesis pathway to be highly enriched. Further analyses of differentially expressed genes and carotenoid components revealed that the truncated BnaA08.PDS3 resulted in decreased carotenoid biosynthesis in the mutant. These results contribute to an understanding of the carotenoid biosynthesis pathway and manipulation of flower-color variation in B. napus.},

However, molecular and cellular mechanisms regulating the assembly and rearrangement of actin filaments (AFs) at plant-pathogen interaction sites remain largely elusive. Here, using live-cell imaging, we show that one of the earliest cellular responses in Arabidopsis thaliana upon powdery mildew attack is the formation of patch-like AF structures beneath fungal invasion sites. The AFs constituting actin patches undergo rapid turnover, which is regulated by the actin-related protein (ARP)2/3 complex and its activator, the WAVE/SCAR regulatory complex (W/SRC). The focal accumulation of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate at fungal penetration sites appears to be a crucial upstream modulator of the W/SRC-ARP2/3 pathway-mediated actin patch formation. Knockout of W/SRC-ARP2/3 pathway subunits partially compromised penetration resistance with impaired endocytic recycling of the defense-associated t-SNARE protein PEN1 and its deposition into apoplastic papillae. Simultaneously knocking out ARP3 and knocking down the Class I formin (AtFH1) abolished actin patch formation, severely impaired the deposition of cell wall appositions, and promoted powdery mildew entry into host cells. Our results demonstrate that the ARP2/3 complex and formins, two actin-nucleating systems, act cooperatively and contribute to Arabidopsis penetration resistance to fungal invasion.},

Clubroot resistance assay on European clubroot differentials (ECD) set revealed that ECD10 (Brassica napus) and ECD4 (Brassica rapa) show a complete resistance to the tested P. brassicae isolate in contrast to highly susceptible hosts Westar (B. napus) and ECD5 (B. rapa). Previously, we used fluorescent probe-based confocal microscopy (FCM) to refine the life cycle of P. brassicae and indicate the important time points during its infection in Arabidopsis. Here, we used FCM to systematically investigate the infection of P. brassicae in two resistant host species ECD10 and ECD4 and two non-host crops wheat and barley at each indicated time points, compared with two susceptible hosts Westar and ECD5. We found that P. brassicae can initiate the primary infection phase and produce uninucleate primary plasmodia in both resistant hosts and non-hosts just like susceptible hosts at 2 days post-inoculation (dpi). Importantly, P. brassicae can develop into zoosporangia and secondary zoospores and release the secondary zoospores from the zoosporangia in resistant hosts at 7 dpi, comparable to susceptible hosts. However, during the secondary infection phase, no secondary plasmodium was detected in the cortical cells of both resistant hosts in contrast to massive secondary plasmodia present in the cortex tissue of two susceptible hosts leading to root swelling at 15 dpi. In both non-host crops, only uninucleate primary plasmodia were observed throughout roots at 7 and 15 dpi. Quantitative PCR based on DNA revealed that the biomass of P. brassicae has no significant increase from 2 dpi in non-host plants and from 7 dpi in resistant host plants, compared to the huge biomass increase in susceptible host plants from 2 to 25 dpi. Our study reveals that the primary infection phase in the root epidermis and the secondary infection phase in the cortex tissue are, respectively, blocked in non-hosts and resistant hosts, contributing to understanding of cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying clubroot non-host and host resistance.},

	abstract = {As a soilborne protist pathogen, Plasmodiophora brassicae causes the devastating clubroot disease on Brassicaeae crops worldwide. Due to its intracellular obligate biotrophic nature, the life cycle of P. brassicae is still not fully understood. Here, we used fluorescent probe-based confocal microscopy and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to investigate the infection process of P. brassicae on the susceptible host Arabidopsis under controlled conditions. We found that P. brassicae can initiate the primary infection in both root hairs and epidermal cells, producing the uninucleate primary plasmodium at 1 day postinoculation (dpi). After that, the developed multinucleate primary plasmodium underwent condensing and cytoplasm cleavage into uninucleate zoosporangia from 1 to 4 dpi. This was subsequently followed by the formation of multinucleate zoosporangia and the production of secondary zoospores within zoosporangium. Importantly, the secondary zoospores performed a conjugation in the root epidermal cells after their release. TEM revealed extensive uninucleate secondary plasmodium in cortical cells at 8 dpi, indicating the establishment of the secondary infection. The P. brassicae subsequently developed into binucleate, quadrinucleate, and multinucleate secondary plasmodia from 10 to 15 dpi, during which the clubroot symptoms appeared. The uninucleate resting spores were first observed in the cortical cells at 24 dpi, marking the completion of a life cycle. We also provided evidence that the secondary infection of P. brassicae may represent the diploid sexual life stage. From these findings, we propose a refined life cycle of P. brassicae which will contribute to understanding of the complicated infection biology of P. brassicae.},

	abstract = {We performed molecular cloning and complete genome sequencing of a novel mycoreovirus, Sclerotinia sclerotiorumreovirus 1 (SsReV1), isolated from an isolate of the phytopathogenic fungus Sclerotinia sclerotiorum. SsReV1 has a genome of 28 055 bp and is composed of 11 double-stranded RNA segments. With a combination of unique molecular features, virion shape and composition, and phylogenetic analysis, SsReV1 is significantly distinct from all known reoviruses and defines a novel genus in the family Reoviridae. Interestingly, two conserved domains, double-stranded RNA binding motif (dsRBM, Pfam 00 035) and reovirus sigma C capsid protein (Reo\_σC, pfam04 582), were identified in the genome of SsReV1, which are widespread in diverse virus lineages. Sequence comparison and phylogenetic analysis revealed that multiple cross-family horizontal gene transfer (HGT) events could occur between reoviruses and double-stranded DNA viruses, single-stranded RNA viruses and even cellular organisms. Interestingly, the dsRBM of SsReV1 was phylogenetically related to dsRNA-binding proteins of some insects, but not reoviruses. These results indicated that SsReV1 is a new taxonomic representative in Reoviridae, which provides new insights into the diversity and global ecology of reoviruses and other segmented double-stranded RNA viruses. More importantly, the present results provided evidence indicating that reoviruses indeed have HGT events with other virus lineages on a large scale and that HGT may serve as an important driving factor that plays a key role in the evolution of reoviruses.},

In this study, we report a novel mycovirus S. sclerotiorum botybirnavirus 1 (SsBRV1) that was originally isolated from the hypovirulent strain SCH941 of S. sclerotiorum. SsBRV1 has rigid spherical virions that are ∼38 nm in diameter, and three double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) segments (dsRNA1, 2, and 3 with lengths of 6.4, 6.0, and 1.7 kbp, respectively) were packaged in the virions. dsRNA1 encodes a cap-pol fusion protein, and dsRNA2 encodes a polyprotein with unknown functions but contributes to the formation of virus particles. The dsRNA3 is dispensable and may be a satellite-like RNA of SsBRV1. Although phylogenetic analysis of the RdRp domain demonstrated that SsBRV1 is related to Botrytis porri RNA virus 1 (BpRV1) and Ustilago maydis dsRNA virus-H1, the structure proteins of SsBRV1 do not have any significant sequence similarities with other known viral proteins with the exception of those of BpRV1. SsBRV1 carrying dsRNA3 seems to have no obvious effects on the colony morphology, but can significantly reduce the growth rate and virulence of S. sclerotiorum. These findings provide new insights into the virus taxonomy, virus evolution and the interactions between SsBRV1 and the fungal hosts.},

	abstract = {Key message This research based on RNA-seq, biochemical, and cytological analyses sheds that ROS may serve as important signaling molecules of cytoplasmic male sterility in CMS-D8 cotton. To understand the mechanism of cytoplasmic male sterility in cotton (Gossypium hirsutum), transcriptomic, cytological, and biochemical analysis were performed between the cytoplasmic male sterility CMS-D8 line, Zhong41A, and its maintainer line Zhong41B. A total of 2335 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in the CMS line at three different stages of anther development. Bioinformatics analysis of these DEGs indicated their relationship to reactive oxygen species (ROS) homeostasis, including reduction-oxidation reactions and the metabolism of glutathione and ascorbate. At the same time, DEGs associated with tapetum development, especially the transition to secretory tapetum, were down-regulated in the CMS line. Biochemical analysis indicated that the ability of the CMS line to eliminate ROS was decreased, which led to the rapid release of H2O2. Cytological analysis revealed that the most crucial defect in the CMS line was the abnormal tapetum. All these results are consistent with the RNA sequencing data. On the basis of our findings, we propose that ROS act as signal molecules, which are released from mitochondria and transferred to the nucleus, triggering the formation of abnormal tapetum.},

	abstract = {Cadmium (Cd) toxicity is a serious threat to future food security and health safety. To identify genetic factors contributing to Cd uptake in wheat, we conducted a genome-wide association study with genotyping from 90K SNP array. A spring wheat diversity panel was planted under normal conditions and Cd stress (50 mg Cd/kg soil). The impact of Cd stress on agronomic traits ranged from a reduction of 16\% in plant height to 93\% in grain iron content. Individual genotypes showed a considerable variation for Cd uptake and translocation subdividing the panel into three groups: (1) hyper-accumulators (i.e. high Leaf\_Cd and low Seed\_Cd ), (2) hyper-translocators (i.e. low Leaf\_Cd and high Seed\_Cd ), and (3) moderate lines (i.e. low Leaf\_Cd and low Seed\_Cd ). Two lines (SKD-1 and TD-1) maintained an optimum grain yield under Cd stress and were therefore considered as Cd resistant lines. Genome-wide association identified 179 SNP-trait associations for various traits including 16 for Cd uptake at a significance level of P {\textless} .001. However, only five SNPs were significant after applying multiple testing correction. These loci were associated with seed-cadmium, grain-iron, and grain-zinc: qSCd-1A, qSCd-1D, qZn-2B1, qZn-2B2, and qFe-6D. These five loci had not been identified in the previously reported studies for Cd uptake in wheat. These loci and the underlying genes should be further investigated using molecular biology techniques to identify Cd resistant genes in wheat.},

A total of 2,446 differentially expressed genes were identified between the anthers of 1355AB lines, at three different stages of development. Cluster analysis and functional assignment of differentially expressed genes revealed differences in transcription associated with pollen wall and anther development, including the metabolism of fatty acids, glucose, pectin and cellulose. Histological and biochemical analysis revealed that a major cellular defect in the 1355A was a thicker nexine, consistent with the RNA-seq data, and further gene expression studies implicated differences in fatty acids synthesis and metabolism. This study provides insight into the phenotypic characteristics and gene regulatory network of the genic male sterile line 1355A in upland cotton.},

We also face the challenge of efficiently applying new transformative biotechnology tools such as gene editing and breeding by genome design to increase rapeseed productivity and profitability. In this Perspective, we review advances in research on the physiological and genetic bases of both stress factors-affected yield stability and seed yield potential, focusing on source–sink relationships and allocation of photosynthetic assimilates to vegetative growth and seed development. We propose research directions and highlight the role of plant architecture in the relative contributions of the root system, leaves, and pods to seed yield. We call for de novo design of new rapeseed crops. We review trait variation in existing germplasm and biotechnologies available for crop design. Finally, we discuss opportunities to apply fundamental knowledge and key germplasm to rapeseed production and propose an ideotype for de novo design of future rapeseed cultivars.},
