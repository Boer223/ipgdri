	abstract = {Plants have evolved a series of strategies to combat pathogen infection. Plant SnRK1 is probably involved in shifting carbon and energy use from growth-associated processes to survival and defence upon pathogen attack, enhancing the resistance to many plant pathogens. The present study demonstrated that SnRK1.1 enhanced the resistance of Arabidopsis thaliana to clubroot disease caused by the plant-pathogenic protozoan Plasmodiophora brassicae. Through a yeast two-hybrid assay, glutathione S-transferase pull-down assay, and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assay, a P. brassicae RxLR effector, PBZF1, was shown to interact with SnRK1.1. Further expression level analysis of SnRK1.1-regulated genes showed that PBZF1 inhibited the biological function of SnRK1.1 as indicated by the disequilibration of the expression level of SnRK1.1-regulated genes in heterogeneous PBZF1-expressing A. thaliana. Moreover, heterogeneous expression of PBZF1 in A. thaliana promoted plant susceptibility to clubroot disease. In addition, PBZF1 was found to be P. brassicae-specific and conserved. This gene was significantly highly expressed in resting spores. Taken together, our results provide new insights into how the plant-pathogenic protist P. brassicae employs an effector to overcome plant resistance, and they offer new insights into the genetic improvement of plant resistance against clubroot disease.},

	abstract = {Glucosinolate (GSL) is associated with clubroot disease, which is caused by the obligate biotrophic protist Plasmodiophora brassicae. Due to the complicated composition of GSLs, their exact role in clubroot disease development remains unclear. By investigating clubroot disease resistance in cruciferous plants and characterizing the GSL content in seeds, we can determine if clubroot disease development is related to the components of GSLs. The difference in the infection process between Matthiola incana L. (resistant) and Brassica napus L. (susceptible) was determined. Root hair infection was definitely observed in both resistant and susceptible hosts, but no infection was observed during the cortical infection stage in resistant roots; this finding was verified by molecular detection of P. brassicae via PCR amplification at various times after inoculation. Based on the time course detection of the contents and compositions of GSLs after P. brassicae inoculation, susceptible roots exhibited increased accumulation of aliphatic, indolic, and aromatic GSLs in B. napus, but only aromatic GSLs were significantly increased in M. incana. Gluconapin, which was the main aliphatic GSL in B. napus and present only in B. napus, was significantly increased during the secondary infection stage. Quantification of the internal jasmonic acid (JA) concentration showed that both resistant and susceptible plants exhibited an enhanced level of JA, particularly in susceptible roots. The exogenous JA treatment induced aliphatic GSLs in B. napus and aromatic GSLs in M. incana. JA-induced aromatic GSLs may be involved in the defense against P. brassicae, whereas aliphatic GSLs induced by JA in B. napus likely play a role during the secondary infection stage. Three candidate MYB28 genes regulate the content of aliphatic GSLs identified in B. napus; one such gene was BnMYB28.1, which was significantly increased following both the treatment with exogenous JA and P. brassicae inoculation. In summary, the increased content of JA during the secondary infection stage may induce the expression of BnMYB28.1, which caused the accumulation of aliphatic GSLs in clubroot disease development.},

	abstract = {Clubroot caused by Plasmodiophora brassicae is an increasingly important soilborne disease in China. The host range of P. brassicae was investigated with 30 cruciferous plants, including 16 crop species, 9 ornamentals, and 5 weeds in field and pot-cultured conditions. In the field, 17 species from five genera produced visible galls, and these included radish, Capsella bursa-pastoris, Orychophragmus violaceus, Sinapis alba, and 13 Brassica crops. In pot-cultured conditions, an additional 13 plant species (11 genera) were determined to be hosts of P. brassicae. Five common weeds were found to be hosts of P. brassicae, including C. bursa-pastoris, Lepidium apetalum, Descurainia sophia, S. alba, and Thellungiella salsuginea. The infection of these plants was confirmed via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with primers specific to P. brassicae. No galls were found on Matthiola incana roots in the field or in pots and no resting spores of P. brassicae were observed in M. incana roots, although P. brassicae was detected in M. incana roots via PCR. Microscopic examination revealed infection only in the root hairs of M. incana roots. These results suggested that M. incana was highly resistant to P. brassicae in China and could be developed as a bait crop. In total, 297 accessions of oilseed rape were tested in the field, and 3 accessions of Brassica napus and 1 accession of B. juncea were found to be highly resistant to clubroot disease. These resistant resources provide options for managing clubroot in P. brassicae-infested fields.},

	abstract = {This study examined the role of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) during the early stage of infection of rapeseed (Brassica napus L.) by the obligate biotrophic protist Plasmodiophora brassicae Woron., which causes clubroot disease. Treatment of infected B. napus seedlings with exogenous IAA promoted the development of clubroot disease, including an increase in the number and size of galls, whereas treatment with N-1-naphthylphthalamic acid (NPA) attenuated the disease and altered the location and size of the root nodules, resulting in a reduced disease index. An increased level of free IAA was detected in the roots at 3 and 7 days after inoculation (DAI) compared with the control, suggesting the activation of IAA signaling in the early stage of P. brassicae infection. Moreover, IAA treatment caused no significant change in the germination rate of the resting spores but resulted in enhanced root hair infection. RT–PCR and quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) were used to analyze the expression of IAA homeostasis-related genes (3, 7, and 10 DAI) to identify gene expression patterns in the roots and leaves of B. napus after inoculation. Five IAA biosynthesis-related genes examined in this study were induced in the roots after inoculation with P. brassicae but not in the leaves. The rapid induction of BnAAO4 expression at 3 DAI may be responsible for the overproduction of IAA during the early stages of infection. This study suggests that IAA acts as a signaling molecule that putatively stimulates root hair infection in the early response of B. napus to P. brassicae infection.},

	abstract = {Shepherd's purse (Capsella bursa-pastoris (L.) Medicus) is an edible and wild medicinal plant widely distributed in China. This plant has been cultivated in Shanghai, China, since the end of the 19th century. Infection of C. bursa-pastoris by Plasmodiophora brassicae, the causal agent of clubroot disease on Brassica spp. has been reported in Korea (2), but is not known to occur in China. In February of 2011, stunted and wilted shepherd's purse (SP) plants were observed in a field planted to oilseed rapes (B. napus) in Sichuan Province of China. Symptomatic SP plants also exhibited root galls. Disease incidence was 6.2\% and 100\% for SP and B. napus, respectively. Root galls on diseased SP plants were collected for pathogen identification. Many resting spores were observed when the root galls were examined under a light microscope. The resting spores were circular in shape, measuring 2.0 to 3.1 μm in diameter (average 2.6 μm). PCR amplification was conducted to confirm the pathogen. DNA was extracted from root galls and healthy roots (control) of SP. Two primers, TC2F (5'-AAACAACGAGTCAGCTTGAATGCTAGTGTG-3') and TC2R (5'-CTTTAGTTGTGTTTCGGCTAGGATGGTTCG-3') were used to detect P. brassicae (1). No PCR amplifications were observed with the control DNA as template. A fragment of the expected size (approximately 520 bp) was obtained when DNA was amplified from diseased roots of SP. These results suggest that the pathogen in the galled roots of SP is P. brassicae. Pathogenicity of P. brassicae in SP was tested on plants of both SP and Chinese cabbage (CC) (B. campestris ssp. pekinensis). A resting spore suspension prepared from naturally infected SP roots was mixed with a sterilized soil in two plastic pots, resulting in a final concentration of 5 × 106 spores/g soil. Soil treated with the same volume of sterile water was used as a control. Seeds of SP and CC were pre-germinated on moist filter paper for 2 days (20°C) and seeded into the infested and control pots, one seed per pot for planted for CC and four seeds per pot for SP. The pots were placed in a chamber at 15 to 25°C under 12 h light and 12 h dark. Plants in each pot were uprooted after 4 weeks and the roots of each plant were washed under tap water and rated for clubroot disease. No disease symptoms were observed in the control treatments of SP or CC. Plants of both species showed symptoms of clubroot, with the disease incidence of 62.5\% and 100\% on SP and CC, respectively. The pathogen was isolated from diseased roots of each plant and confirmed as P. brassicae based on morphological characteristics and PCR detection. To our knowledge, this is the first report of clubroot disease on C. bursa-pastoris in Sichuan Province of China. This finding suggests that it may be necessary to manage C. bursa-pastoris in cruciferous vegetable (cabbage, turnip) and oilseed rape production fields. References: (1) T. Cao et al.

	abstract = {In plants, phloem is not only a vital structure that is used for nutrient transportation, but it is also the location of a response that defends against various stresses, named phloem-based defense (PBD). Phloem proteins (PP2s) are among the predominant proteins in phloem, indicating their potential functional role in PBD. Sclerotinia disease (SD), which is caused by the necrotrophic fungal pathogen S. sclerotiorum (Sclerotinia sclerotiorum), is a devastating disease that affects oil crops, especially Brassica napus (B. napus), mainly by blocking nutrition and water transportation through xylem and phloem. Presently, the role of PP2s in SD resistance is still largely estimated. Therefore, in this study, we identified 62 members of the PP2 gene family in the B. napus genome with an uneven distribution across the 19 chromosomes. A phylogenetic analysis classified the BnPP2s into four clusters (I-IV), with cluster I containing the most members (28 genes) as a consequence of its frequent genome segmental duplication. A comparison of the gene structures and conserved motifs suggested that BnPP2 genes were well conserved in clusters II to IV, but were variable in cluster I. Interestingly, the motifs in different clusters displayed unique features, such as motif 6 specifically existing in cluster III and motif 1 being excluded from cluster IV. These results indicated the possible functional specification of BnPP2s. A transcriptome data analysis showed that the genes in clusters II to IV exhibited dynamic expression alternation in tissues and the stimulation of S. sclerotiorum, suggesting that they could participate in SD resistance. A GWAS analysis of a rapeseed population comprising 324 accessions identified four BnPP2 genes that were potentially responsible for SD resistance and a transgenic study that was conducted by transiently expressing BnPP2-6 in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) leaves validated their positive role in regulating SD resistance in terms of reduced lesion size after inoculation with S. sclerotiorum hyphal plugs. This study provides useful information on PP2 gene functions in B. napus and could aid elaborated functional studies on the PP2 gene family.},

	abstract = {As one of the largest classes of lectins, legume lectins have a variety of desirable features such as antibacterial and insecticidal activities as well as anti-abiotic stress ability. The Sclerotinia disease (SD) caused by the soil-borne fungus Sclerotinia sclerotiorum is a devastating disease affecting most oil crops such as Brassica napus. Here, we identified 130 legume lectin (LegLu) genes in B. napus, which could be phylogenetically classified into seven clusters. The BnLegLu gene family has been significantly expanded since the whole-genome duplication (WGD) or segmental duplication. Gene structure and conserved motif analysis suggested that the BnLegLu genes were well conserved in each cluster. Moreover, relative to those genes only containing the legume lectin domain in cluster VI–VII, the genes in cluster I–V harbored a transmembrane domain and a kinase domain linked to the legume lectin domain in the C terminus. The expression of most BnLegLu genes was relatively low in various tissues. Thirty-five BnLegLu genes were responsive to abiotic stress, and 40 BnLegLu genes were strongly induced by S. sclerotiorum, with a most significant up-regulation of 715-fold, indicating their functional roles in SD resistance. Four BnLegLu genes were located in the candidate regions of genome-wide association analysis (GWAS) results which resulted from a worldwide rapeseed population consisting of 324 accessions associated with SD. Among them, the positive role of BnLegLus-16 in SD resistance was validated by transient expression in tobacco leaves. This study provides important information on BnLegLu genes, particularly about their roles in SD resistance, which may help targeted functional research and genetic improvement in the breeding of B. napus.},

The growing demand for oilseeds has necessitated the development of rapeseed varieties with improved quality. Therefore, a clear understanding of the genetic basis underlying the seed oil content (SOC) is required. In this study, a natural population comprising 204 diverse accessions and recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from Brassica napus and Sinapis alba via distant hybridization were collected for genome-wide association analysis (GWAS) and quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping of the SOC trait, respectively. The variable coefficient of the RIL and natural populations ranged from 7.43 to 10.43\% and 8.40 to 10.91\%. Then, a high-density linkage map was constructed based on whole genome re-sequencing (WGS); the map harbored 2,799 bin markers and covered a total distance of 1,835.21 cM, with an average marker interval of 0.66 cM. The QTLs for SOC on chromosome A07 were stably detected in both single and multiple environments. Finally, a novel locus qA07.SOC was identified as the major QTL for SOC based on the GWAS and RIL populations. In addition, the RNA-seq results showed that photosynthesis, lipid biosynthesis proteins, fatty acid metabolism, and unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis were significantly different between the developed seeds of the two parents of the RIL population. By comparing the variation information and expression levels of the syntenic genes within qA07.SOC and its syntenic genomic regions, as well as through haplotype analysis via GWAS, BnaA07.STR18, BnaA07.NRT1, and BnaA07g12880D were predicted as candidate genes in the qA07.SOC interval.

In each subfamily, the genes showed relatively conserved structures and motifs, but displayed distinct expression patterns in different tissues and under abiotic stress, which might be caused by the varied cis-acting regulatory elements among them. Transcriptome datasets from Pacbio/Illumina platforms showed that alternative splicing of SR genes was widespread in B. napus and the majority of paralogous gene pairs displayed different splicing patterns. Protein-protein interaction analysis indicated that SR proteins were involved in the regulation of the whole lifecycle of mRNA, from synthesis to decay. Moreover, the association mapping analysis suggested that 12 SR genes were candidate genes for regulating specific agronomic traits, which indicated that SR genes could affect the development and hence influence the important agronomic traits of B. napus.

Therefore, in this study, we performed genome-wide analysis to identify the ARI gene family and explore their potential importance in B. napus. A total of 39 ARI genes were identified in the B. napus genome and were classified into three subfamilies (A, B and C) based on phylogenetic analysis. The protein-protein interaction networks and enrichment analysis indicated that BnARI genes could be involved in endoreduplication, DNA repair, proteasome assembly, ubiquitination, protein kinase activity and stress adaptation. The transcriptome data analysis in various tissues provided us an indication of some BnARI genes' functional importance in tissue development. We also identified potential BnARI genes that were significantly responsive towards the abiotic stresses. Furthermore, eight BnARI genes were identified as candidate genes for multiple agronomic traits through association mapping analysis in B. napus; among them, BnaA02g12100D, which is the ortholog of AtARI8, was significantly associated with ten agronomic traits.

	abstract = {SET domain group encoding proteins function as histone lysine methyltransferases. These proteins are involved in various biological processes, including plant development and adaption to the environment by modifying the chromatin structures. So far, the SET domain genes (SDGs) have not been systematically investigated in Brassica napus (B. napus). In the current study, through genome-wide analysis, a total of 122 SDGs were identified in the B. napus genome. These BnSDGs were subdivided into seven (I-VII) classes based on phylogeny analysis, domain configurations, and motif distribution. Segmental duplication was involved in the evolution of this family, and the duplicated genes were under strong purifying selection. The promoter sequence of BnSDGs consisted of various growth, hormones, and stress-related cis-acting elements along with transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) for 20 TF families in 59 of the 122 BnSDGs. The gene ontology (GO) analysis revealed that BnSDGs were closely associated with histone and non-histone methylation and metal binding capacity localized mostly in the nucleus. The in silico expression analysis at four developmental stages in leaf, stem root, floral organ, silique, and seed tissues showed a broad range of tissue and stage-specific expression pattern. The expression analysis under four abiotic stresses (dehydration, cold, ABA, and salinity) also provided evidence for the importance of BnSDGs in stress environments. Based on expression analysis, we performed reverse transcription-quantitative PCR for 15 target BnSDGs in eight tissues (young leaf, mature leaf, root, stem, carpel, stamen, sepal, and petals). Our results were in accordance with the in silico expression data, suggesting the importance of these genes in plant development. In conclusion, this study lays a foundation for future functional studies on SDGs in B. napus.},

	abstract = {Cupin\_1 domain-containing proteins (CDPs) are ubiquitously present in higher plants, which are known to play essential roles in various biological processes. In this study, we carried out genome-wide characterization and systematic investigation of the CDP genes in Brassica napus. A total of 96 BnCDPs, including 71 germin-like proteins (GLPs; proteins with a single cupin\_1 domain) and 25 CDP bicupins (proteins with two cupin\_1 domains), were identified and clustered into six distinct subfamilies (I–VI) based on the phylogenic analysis, gene structure and motif distribution. Further analysis indicated that whole-genome duplication (WGD) and segmental duplication are main contributors to the species-specific expansion of the BnCDP gene family, and all the duplicated genes subsequently underwent strong purification selection. The promoter region of BnCDPs showed enrichment of cis-regulatory elements associated with development, hormone and stress, as well as transcription factor binding sites, which validates the prediction that BnCDPs are widely involved in plant growth and biotic and abiotic stress responses. The BnCDPs in different subfamilies exhibited obvious differences in expression among 30 developmental tissues/stages of B. napus, implying that BnCDPs may be involved in tissue- and stage-specific developmental processes. Similar trends in expression of most BnCDPs were observed under Sclerotinia sclerotiorum inoculation and four abiotic stresses (dehydration, cold, ABA and salinity), particularly the BnGLPs in subfamily I and III with single cupin\_1 domain, revealing that BnCDPs are of great importance in the environmental adaption of B. napus. We then performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 274 B. napus core germplasms on S. sclerotiorum resistance and identified four significantly associated loci harboring five BnGLPs. The expression levels of two candidate genes, BnGLP1.A08 and BnGLP1.C08, were significantly correlated with S. sclerotiorum resistance. Their functional responses to multiple stages of S. sclerotiorum inoculation and four abiotic stresses were further examined through qPCR. Overall, this study provides rich resources for research on the function and evolutionary playground of CDP genes.},

	abstract = {Traits related to flowering time are the most promising agronomic traits that directly impact the seed yield and oil quality of rapeseed (Brassica napus L.). Developing early flowering and maturity rapeseed varieties is an important breeding objective in B. napus. Many studies have reported on days to flowering, but few have reported on budding, bolting, and the interval between bolting and DTF. Therefore, elucidating the genetic architecture of QTLs and genes regulating flowering time, we presented an integrated investigation on SNP and haplotype-based genome-wide association study of 373 diverse B. napus germplasm, which were genotyped by the 60K SNP array and were phenotyped in the four environments. The results showed that a total of 15 and 37 QTLs were detected from SNP and haplotype-based GWAS, respectively. Among them, seven QTL clusters were identified by haplotype-based GWAS. Moreover, three and eight environmentally stable QTLs were detected by SNP-GWAS and haplotype-based GWAS, respectively. By integrating the above two approaches and by co-localizing the four traits, ten (10) genomic regions were under selection on chromosomes A03, A07, A08, A10, C06, C07, and C08. Interestingly, the genomic regions FT.A07.1, FT.A08, FT.C06, and FT.C07 were identified as novel. In these ten regions, a total of 197 genes controlling FT were detected, of which 14 highly expressed DEGs were orthologous to 13 Arabidopsis thaliana genes after integration with transcriptome results. In a nutshell, the above results uncovered the genetic architecture of important agronomic traits related to flowering time and provided a basis for multiple molecular marker-trait associations in B. napus.},

	abstract = {Plant height is a crucial element related to plant architecture that influences the seed yield of oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.). In this study, we isolated a natural B. napus mutant, namely a semi-dwarf mutant (sdw-e), which exhibits a 30\% reduction in plant height compared to Zhongshuang 11-HP (ZS11-HP). Quantitative trait locus sequencing (QTL-seq) was conducted using two extreme DNA bulks in F2 populations in Wuchang-2017 derived from ZS11-HP × sdw-e to identify QTLs associated with plant height. The result suggested that two QTL intervals were located on chromosome A10. The F2 population consisting of 200 individuals in Yangluo-2018 derived from ZS11-HP × sdw-e was used to construct a high-density linkage map using whole-genome resequencing. The high-density linkage map harbored 4323 bin markers and covered a total distance of 2026.52 cM with an average marker interval of 0.47 cM. The major QTL for plant height named qPHA10 was identified on linkage group A10 by interval mapping (IM) and composite interval mapping (CIM) methods. The major QTL qPHA10 was highly consistent with the QTL-seq results. And then, we integrated the variation sites and expression levels of genes in the major QTL interval to predict the candidate genes. Thus, the identified QTL and candidate genes could be used in marker-assisted selection for B. napus breeding in the future.},

We mapped yvl locus to a 70-kb interval between molecular markers yvl-O10 and InDel-O6 on chromosome A03 in BC2F2 population using whole genome re-sequencing and bulked segregant analysis. The mutant had a 'C' to 'T' substitution in the coding sequence of BnaA03.CHLH, which encodes putative H subunit of Mg-protoporphyrin IX chelatase (CHLH). The mutation resulted in an imperfect protein structure and reduced activity of CHLH. It also hampered the plastid encoded RNA polymerase which transcribes regulatory genes of photosystem II and I. Consequently, the chlorophyll a/b and carotenoid contents were reduced and the chloroplast ultrastructure was degraded in yvl mutant. These results explain that a single nucleotide mutation in BnaA03.CHLH impairs PEP activity to disrupt chloroplast development and chlorophyll biosynthesis in B. napus.},

	abstract = {Tung tree (Vernicia fordii) is an economically important woody oil plant that produces tung oil rich in eleostearic acid. Here, we report a high-quality chromosome-scale genome sequence of tung tree. The genome sequence was assembled by combining Illumina short reads, Pacific Biosciences single-molecule real-time long reads, and Hi-C sequencing data. The size of tung tree genome is 1.12 Gb, with 28,422 predicted genes and over 73\% repeat sequences. The V. fordii underwent an ancient genome triplication event shared by core eudicots but no further whole-genome duplication in the subsequent ca. 34.55 million years of evolutionary history of the tung tree lineage. Insertion time analysis revealed that repeat-driven genome expansion might have arisen as a result of long-standing long terminal repeat retrotransposon bursts and lack of efficient DNA deletion mechanisms. The genome harbors 88 resistance genes encoding nucleotide-binding sites; 17 of these genes may be involved in early-infection stage of Fusarium wilt resistance. Further, 651 oil-related genes were identified, 88 of which are predicted to be directly involved in tung oil biosynthesis. Relatively few phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase genes, and synergistic effects between transcription factors and oil biosynthesis-related genes might contribute to the high oil content of tung seed. The tung tree genome constitutes a valuable resource for understanding genome evolution, as well as for molecular breeding and genetic improvements for oil production.},

The relationship between Microcystis and the associated bacteria was investigated by a metagenomic approach in this study. We developed a visualization-guided method of binning for genome assembly after total colony DNA sequencing. We found that the method was effective in grouping sequences and it did not require reference genome sequence. Individual genomes of the colony bacteria were obtained and they provided valuable insights into microbial community structures. Analysis of metabolic pathways based on these genomes revealed that while all heterotrophic bacteria were dependent upon Microcystis for carbon and energy, Vitamin B12 biosynthesis, which is required for growth by Microcystis, was accomplished in a cooperative fashion among the bacteria. Our analysis also suggests that individual bacteria in the colony community contributed a complete pathway for degradation of benzoate, which is inhibitory to the cyanobacterial growth, and its ecological implication for Microcystis bloom is discussed.},

Although yellowish flower color is a common variant observed in field-grown oilseed rape, the genetics behind this variation remains unclear. We obtained a yellowish-white flower (ywf) mutant from Zhongshuang 9 (ZS9) by ethyl methanesulfonate mutagenesis (EMS) treatment. Compared with ZS9, ywf exhibited a lower carotenoid content with a reduced and defective chromoplast ultrastructure in the petals. Genetic analysis revealed that the yellowish-white trait was controlled by a single recessive gene. Using bulked-segregant analysis sequencing (BSA-seq) and kompetitive allele-specific PCR (KASP), we performed map-based cloning of the ywf locus on chromosome A08 and found that ywf harbored a C-to-T substitution in the coding region, resulting in a premature translation termination. YWF, encoding phytoene desaturase 3 (PDS3), was highly expressed in oilseed rape petals and involved in carotenoid biosynthesis. Pathway enrichment analysis of the transcriptome profiles from ZS9 and ywf indicated the carotenoid biosynthesis pathway to be highly enriched. Further analyses of differentially expressed genes and carotenoid components revealed that the truncated BnaA08.PDS3 resulted in decreased carotenoid biosynthesis in the mutant. These results contribute to an understanding of the carotenoid biosynthesis pathway and manipulation of flower-color variation in B. napus.},

However, molecular and cellular mechanisms regulating the assembly and rearrangement of actin filaments (AFs) at plant-pathogen interaction sites remain largely elusive. Here, using live-cell imaging, we show that one of the earliest cellular responses in Arabidopsis thaliana upon powdery mildew attack is the formation of patch-like AF structures beneath fungal invasion sites. The AFs constituting actin patches undergo rapid turnover, which is regulated by the actin-related protein (ARP)2/3 complex and its activator, the WAVE/SCAR regulatory complex (W/SRC). The focal accumulation of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate at fungal penetration sites appears to be a crucial upstream modulator of the W/SRC-ARP2/3 pathway-mediated actin patch formation. Knockout of W/SRC-ARP2/3 pathway subunits partially compromised penetration resistance with impaired endocytic recycling of the defense-associated t-SNARE protein PEN1 and its deposition into apoplastic papillae. Simultaneously knocking out ARP3 and knocking down the Class I formin (AtFH1) abolished actin patch formation, severely impaired the deposition of cell wall appositions, and promoted powdery mildew entry into host cells. Our results demonstrate that the ARP2/3 complex and formins, two actin-nucleating systems, act cooperatively and contribute to Arabidopsis penetration resistance to fungal invasion.},

Clubroot resistance assay on European clubroot differentials (ECD) set revealed that ECD10 (Brassica napus) and ECD4 (Brassica rapa) show a complete resistance to the tested P. brassicae isolate in contrast to highly susceptible hosts Westar (B. napus) and ECD5 (B. rapa). Previously, we used fluorescent probe-based confocal microscopy (FCM) to refine the life cycle of P. brassicae and indicate the important time points during its infection in Arabidopsis. Here, we used FCM to systematically investigate the infection of P. brassicae in two resistant host species ECD10 and ECD4 and two non-host crops wheat and barley at each indicated time points, compared with two susceptible hosts Westar and ECD5. We found that P. brassicae can initiate the primary infection phase and produce uninucleate primary plasmodia in both resistant hosts and non-hosts just like susceptible hosts at 2 days post-inoculation (dpi). Importantly, P. brassicae can develop into zoosporangia and secondary zoospores and release the secondary zoospores from the zoosporangia in resistant hosts at 7 dpi, comparable to susceptible hosts. However, during the secondary infection phase, no secondary plasmodium was detected in the cortical cells of both resistant hosts in contrast to massive secondary plasmodia present in the cortex tissue of two susceptible hosts leading to root swelling at 15 dpi. In both non-host crops, only uninucleate primary plasmodia were observed throughout roots at 7 and 15 dpi. Quantitative PCR based on DNA revealed that the biomass of P. brassicae has no significant increase from 2 dpi in non-host plants and from 7 dpi in resistant host plants, compared to the huge biomass increase in susceptible host plants from 2 to 25 dpi. Our study reveals that the primary infection phase in the root epidermis and the secondary infection phase in the cortex tissue are, respectively, blocked in non-hosts and resistant hosts, contributing to understanding of cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying clubroot non-host and host resistance.},

	abstract = {As a soilborne protist pathogen, Plasmodiophora brassicae causes the devastating clubroot disease on Brassicaeae crops worldwide. Due to its intracellular obligate biotrophic nature, the life cycle of P. brassicae is still not fully understood. Here, we used fluorescent probe-based confocal microscopy and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to investigate the infection process of P. brassicae on the susceptible host Arabidopsis under controlled conditions. We found that P. brassicae can initiate the primary infection in both root hairs and epidermal cells, producing the uninucleate primary plasmodium at 1 day postinoculation (dpi). After that, the developed multinucleate primary plasmodium underwent condensing and cytoplasm cleavage into uninucleate zoosporangia from 1 to 4 dpi. This was subsequently followed by the formation of multinucleate zoosporangia and the production of secondary zoospores within zoosporangium. Importantly, the secondary zoospores performed a conjugation in the root epidermal cells after their release. TEM revealed extensive uninucleate secondary plasmodium in cortical cells at 8 dpi, indicating the establishment of the secondary infection. The P. brassicae subsequently developed into binucleate, quadrinucleate, and multinucleate secondary plasmodia from 10 to 15 dpi, during which the clubroot symptoms appeared. The uninucleate resting spores were first observed in the cortical cells at 24 dpi, marking the completion of a life cycle. We also provided evidence that the secondary infection of P. brassicae may represent the diploid sexual life stage. From these findings, we propose a refined life cycle of P. brassicae which will contribute to understanding of the complicated infection biology of P. brassicae.},

SsReV1 has a genome of 28 055 bp and is composed of 11 double-stranded RNA segments. With a combination of unique molecular features, virion shape and composition, and phylogenetic analysis, SsReV1 is significantly distinct from all known reoviruses and defines a novel genus in the family Reoviridae. Interestingly, two conserved domains, double-stranded RNA binding motif (dsRBM, Pfam 00 035) and reovirus sigma C capsid protein (Reo\_σC, pfam04 582), were identified in the genome of SsReV1, which are widespread in diverse virus lineages. Sequence comparison and phylogenetic analysis revealed that multiple cross-family horizontal gene transfer (HGT) events could occur between reoviruses and double-stranded DNA viruses, single-stranded RNA viruses and even cellular organisms. Interestingly, the dsRBM of SsReV1 was phylogenetically related to dsRNA-binding proteins of some insects, but not reoviruses. These results indicated that SsReV1 is a new taxonomic representative in Reoviridae, which provides new insights into the diversity and global ecology of reoviruses and other segmented double-stranded RNA viruses. More importantly, the present results provided evidence indicating that reoviruses indeed have HGT events with other virus lineages on a large scale and that HGT may serve as an important driving factor that plays a key role in the evolution of reoviruses.},

SsBRV1 has rigid spherical virions that are ∼38 nm in diameter, and three double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) segments (dsRNA1, 2, and 3 with lengths of 6.4, 6.0, and 1.7 kbp, respectively) were packaged in the virions. dsRNA1 encodes a cap-pol fusion protein, and dsRNA2 encodes a polyprotein with unknown functions but contributes to the formation of virus particles. The dsRNA3 is dispensable and may be a satellite-like RNA of SsBRV1. Although phylogenetic analysis of the RdRp domain demonstrated that SsBRV1 is related to Botrytis porri RNA virus 1 (BpRV1) and Ustilago maydis dsRNA virus-H1, the structure proteins of SsBRV1 do not have any significant sequence similarities with other known viral proteins with the exception of those of BpRV1. SsBRV1 carrying dsRNA3 seems to have no obvious effects on the colony morphology, but can significantly reduce the growth rate and virulence of S. sclerotiorum.

To understand the mechanism of cytoplasmic male sterility in cotton (Gossypium hirsutum), transcriptomic, cytological, and biochemical analysis were performed between the cytoplasmic male sterility CMS-D8 line, Zhong41A, and its maintainer line Zhong41B. A total of 2335 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in the CMS line at three different stages of anther development. Bioinformatics analysis of these DEGs indicated their relationship to reactive oxygen species (ROS) homeostasis, including reduction-oxidation reactions and the metabolism of glutathione and ascorbate. At the same time, DEGs associated with tapetum development, especially the transition to secretory tapetum, were down-regulated in the CMS line. Biochemical analysis indicated that the ability of the CMS line to eliminate ROS was decreased, which led to the rapid release of H2O2. Cytological analysis revealed that the most crucial defect in the CMS line was the abnormal tapetum. All these results are consistent with the RNA sequencing data. On the basis of our findings, we propose that ROS act as signal molecules, which are released from mitochondria and transferred to the nucleus, triggering the formation of abnormal tapetum.},

	abstract = {Cadmium (Cd) toxicity is a serious threat to future food security and health safety. To identify genetic factors contributing to Cd uptake in wheat, we conducted a genome-wide association study with genotyping from 90K SNP array. A spring wheat diversity panel was planted under normal conditions and Cd stress (50 mg Cd/kg soil). The impact of Cd stress on agronomic traits ranged from a reduction of 16\% in plant height to 93\% in grain iron content. Individual genotypes showed a considerable variation for Cd uptake and translocation subdividing the panel into three groups: (1) hyper-accumulators (i.e. high Leaf\_Cd and low Seed\_Cd ), (2) hyper-translocators (i.e. low Leaf\_Cd and high Seed\_Cd ), and (3) moderate lines (i.e. low Leaf\_Cd and low Seed\_Cd ). Two lines (SKD-1 and TD-1) maintained an optimum grain yield under Cd stress and were therefore considered as Cd resistant lines. Genome-wide association identified 179 SNP-trait associations for various traits including 16 for Cd uptake at a significance level of P {\textless} .001. However, only five SNPs were significant after applying multiple testing correction. These loci were associated with seed-cadmium, grain-iron, and grain-zinc: qSCd-1A, qSCd-1D, qZn-2B1, qZn-2B2, and qFe-6D. These five loci had not been identified in the previously reported studies for Cd uptake in wheat. These loci and the underlying genes should be further investigated using molecular biology techniques to identify Cd resistant genes in wheat.},

Brown planthopper (BPH) is the most severe insect of rice, and the biotypes adapt to feed on different rice genotypes. Here, we present genomics analyses on 1,520 global rice germplasms for resistance to three BPH biotypes. Genome-wide association studies identified 3,502 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 59 loci associated with BPH resistance in rice. We cloned a previously unidentified gene Bph37 that confers resistance to BPH. The associated loci showed high nucleotide diversity. Genome-wide scans for trans-species polymorphisms revealed ancient balancing selection at the loci. The secondarily evolved insect biotypes II and III exhibited significantly higher virulence and overcame more rice varieties than the primary biotype I. In response, more SNPs and loci evolved in rice for resistance to biotypes II and III. Notably, three exceptional large regions with high SNP density and resistance-associated loci on chromosomes 4 and 6 appear distinct between the resistant and susceptible rice varieties. Surprisingly, these regions in resistant rice might have been retained from wild species Oryza nivara. Our findings expand the understanding of long-term interactions between rice and BPH and provide resistance genes and germplasm resources for breeding durable BPH-resistant rice varieties.},

	abstract = {Multi-functional microRNAs (miRNAs) are emerging as key modulators of plant-pathogen interactions. Although the involvement of some miRNAs in plant-insect interactions has been revealed, the underlying mechanisms are still elusive. The brown planthopper (BPH) is the most notorious rice (Oryza sativa)-specific insect that causes severe yield losses each year and requires urgent biological control. To reveal the miRNAs involved in rice-BPH interactions, we performed miRNA sequencing and identified BPH-responsive OsmiR396. Sequestering OsmiR396 by overexpressing target mimicry (MIM396) in three genetic backgrounds indicated that OsmiR396 negatively regulated BPH resistance. Overexpression of one BPH-responsive target gene of OsmiR396, growth regulating factor 8 (OsGRF8), showed resistance to BPH. Furthermore, the flavonoid contents increased in both the OsmiR396-sequestered and the OsGRF8 overexpressing plants. By analysing 39 natural rice varieties, the elevated flavonoid contents were found to correlate with enhanced BPH resistance. Artificial applications of flavonoids to wild type (WT) plants also increased resistance to BPH. A BPH-responsive flavanone 3-hydroxylase (OsF3H) gene in the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway was proved to be directly regulated by OsGRF8. A genetic functional analysis of OsF3H revealed its positive role in mediating both the flavonoid contents and BPH resistance. And analysis of the genetic correlation between OsmiR396 and OsF3H showed that down-regulation of OsF3H complemented the BPH resistance characteristic and simultaneously decreased the flavonoid contents of the MIM396 plants. Thus, we revealed a new BPH resistance mechanism mediated by the OsmiR396-OsGRF8-OsF3H-flavonoid pathway. Our study suggests potential applications of miRNAs in BPH resistance breeding.},

	abstract = {Phloem-feeding insects cause massive losses in agriculture and horticulture. Host plant resistance to phloem-feeding insects is often mediated by changes in phloem composition, which deter insect settling and feeding and decrease viability. Here, we report that rice plant resistance to the phloem-feeding brown planthopper (BPH) is associated with fortification of the sclerenchyma tissue, which is located just beneath the epidermis and a cell layer or two away from the vascular bundle in the rice leaf sheath. We found that BPHs prefer to feed on the smooth and soft region on the surface of rice leaf sheaths called the long-cell block. We identified Bph30 as a rice BPH resistance gene that prevents BPH stylets from reaching the phloem due to the fortified sclerenchyma. Bph30 is strongly expressed in sclerenchyma cells and enhances cellulose and hemicellulose synthesis, making the cell walls stiffer and sclerenchyma thicker. The structurally fortified sclerenchyma is a formidable barrier preventing BPH stylets from penetrating the leaf sheath tissues and arriving at the phloem to feed. Bph30 belongs to a novel gene family, encoding a protein with two leucine-rich domains. Another member of the family, Bph40, also conferred resistance to BPH. Collectively, the fortified sclerenchyma-mediated resistance mechanism revealed in this study expands our understanding of plant-insect interactions and opens a new path for controlling planthoppers in rice.},

We hypothesized that the EXO70-dependent trafficking pathway affects the excretion of resistance-related proteins, thus impacting plant resistance to planthoppers. Here, we further explored the function of EXO70 members in rice resistance against planthoppers. We used the yeast two-hybrid and co-immunoprecipitation assays to identify proteins that play roles in Bph6-mediated planthopper resistance. The functions of the identified proteins were characterized via gene transformation, plant resistance evaluation, insect performance, cell excretion observation and cell wall component analyses. We discovered that another EXO70 member, OsEXO70H3, interacted with BPH6 and functioned in cell excretion and in Bph6-mediated planthopper resistance. We further found that OsEXO70H3 interacted with an S-adenosylmethionine synthetase-like protein (SAMSL) and increased the delivery of SAMSL outside the cells. The functional impairment of OsEXO70H3 and SAMSL reduced the lignin content and the planthopper resistance level of rice plants. Our results suggest that OsEXO70H3 may recruit SAMSL and help its excretion to the apoplast where it may be involved in lignin deposition in cell walls, thus contributing to rice resistance to planthoppers.},

Here, we identified an N. lugens Salivary Protein 1 (NlSP1) by screening salivary proteome and characterized its functions in BPH and plants. NlSP1 induces cell death, H2O2 accumulation, the expression of defense-related genes, and callose deposition in planta. The active region of NlSP1 that induces plant cell death is located in its N-terminal region. Inhibition of NlSP1 expression in BPHs reduced their feeding ability and had a lethal effect on them. Most importantly, we demonstrated that NlSP1 was able to be secreted into rice plant during feeding process and form a complex with certain interacting partner of rice.

	abstract = {Sclerotinia stem rot (SSR) caused by Sclerotinia sclerotiorum (S. sclerotiorum) is the main disease threat of oilseed rape (Brassica napus), resulting in huge economic losses every year. SSR resistance manifests as quantitative disease resistance (QDR), and no gene with complete SSR resistance has been cloned or reported so far. Transcriptome analysis has revealed a large number of defense-related genes and response processes. However, the similarities and differences in the defense responses of different tissues are rarely reported. In this study, we analyzed the similarities and differences of different tissues in response to S. sclerotiorum at 24 h post inoculation (hpi) by using the published transcriptome data for respective leaf and stem inoculation. At 24 hpi, large differences in gene expression exist in leaf and stem, and there are more differentially expressed genes and larger expression differences in leaf. The leaf is more sensitive to S. sclerotiorum and shows a stronger response than stem. Different defense responses appear in the leaf and stem, and the biosynthesis of lignin, callose, lectin, chitinase, PGIP, and PR protein is activated in leaf. In the stem, lipid metabolism-mediated defense responses are obviously enhanced. For the common defense responses in both leaf and stem, the chain reactions resulting from signal transduction and biological process take the primary responsibility. This research will be beneficial to exploit the potential of different tissues in plant defense and find higher resistance levels of genotypic variability in different environments. Our results are significant in the identification of resistance genes and analysis of defense mechanisms.},

	abstract = {Methionine (Met) synthesized from aspartate is a fundamental amino acid needed to produce S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) that is an important cofactor for the methylation of monolignols. As a competitive inhibitor of SAM-dependent methylation, the effect of S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) on lignin biosynthesis, however, is still largely unknown in plants. Expression levels of Cystathionine γ-synthase (PvCGS) and S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase 1 (PvSAHH1) were down-regulated by RNAi technology, respectively, in switchgrass, a dual-purpose forage and biofuel crop. The transgenic switchgrass lines were subjected to studying the impact of SAH on lignin biosynthesis. Our results showed that down-regulation of PvCGS in switchgrass altered the accumulation of aspartate-derived and aromatic amino acids, reduced the content of SAH, enhanced lignin biosynthesis and stunted plant growth. In contrast, down-regulation of PvSAHH1 raised SAH levels in switchgrass, impaired the biosynthesis of both guaiacyl and syringyl lignins and therefore significantly increased saccharification efficiency of cell walls. This work indicates that SAH plays a crucial role in monolignol methylation in switchgrass. Genetic regulation of either PvCGS or PvSAHH1 expression in switchgrass can change intracellular SAH contents and SAM to SAH ratios and therefore affect lignin biosynthesis. Thus, our study suggests that genes involved in Met metabolism are of interest as new valuable targets for cell wall bioengineering in future.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Copy number variation (CNV), a complex genomic rearrangement, has been extensively studied in humans and other organisms. In plants, CNVs of several genes were found to be responsible for various important traits; however, the cause and consequence of CNVs remains largely unknown. Recently released next-generation sequencing (NGS) data provide an opportunity for a genome-wide study of CNVs in rice.
RESULTS: Here, by an NGS-based approach, we generated a CNV map comprising 9,196 deletions compared to the reference genome 'Nipponbare'. Using Oryza glaberrima as the outgroup, 80\% of the CNV events turned out to be insertions in Nipponbare. There were 2,806 annotated genes affected by these CNV events. We experimentally validated 28 functional CNV genes including OsMADS56, BPH14, OsDCL2b and OsMADS30, implying that CNVs might have contributed to phenotypic variations in rice. Most CNV genes were found to be located in non-co-linear positions by comparison to O. glaberrima. One of the origins of these non-co-linear genes was genomic duplications caused by transposon activity or double-strand break repair. Comprehensive analysis of mutation mechanisms suggested an abundance of CNVs formed by non-homologous end-joining and mobile element insertion.
CONCLUSIONS: This study showed the impact and origin of copy number variations in rice on a genomic scale.},

Medicago truncatula is an ideal model plant for genetic research in legumes, and specifically for studying nodulation, which is crucial for nitrogen fixation. In this study, 59 MtGRAS genes were identified and classified into eight distinct subgroups based on phylogenetic relationships. Motifs located in the C-termini were conserved across the subgroups, while motifs in the N-termini were subfamily specific. Gene duplication was the main evolutionary force for MtGRAS expansion, especially proliferation of the LISCL subgroup. Seventeen duplicated genes showed strong effects of purifying selection and diverse expression patterns, highlighting their functional importance and diversification after duplication. Thirty MtGRAS genes, including NSP1 and NSP2, were preferentially expressed in nodules, indicating possible roles in the process of nodulation. A transcriptome study, combined with gene expression analysis under different stress conditions, suggested potential functions of MtGRAS genes in various biological pathways and stress responses. Taken together, these comprehensive analyses provide basic information for understanding the potential functions of GRAS genes, and will facilitate further discovery of MtGRAS gene functions.},

Because the flower petals play pivotal roles in the SSR disease cycle, it is useful to express the resistance-related genes specifically in flowers to hinder further infection with S. sclerotiorum. To screen flower-specific promoters, we first analyzed the transcriptome data from 12 different tissues of the B. napus line ZS11. In total, 249 flower-specific candidate genes with high expression in petals were identified, and the expression patterns of 30 candidate genes were verified by quantitative real-time transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis. Furthermore, two novel flower-specific promoters (FSP046 and FSP061 promoter) were identified, and the tissue specificity and continuous expression in petals were determined in transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana with fusing the promoters to β-glucuronidase (GUS)-reporter gene. GUS staining, transcript expression pattern, and GUS activity analysis indicated that FSP046 and FSP061 promoter were strictly flower-specific promoters, and FSP046 promoter had a stronger activity. The two promoters were further confirmed to be able to direct GUS expression in B. napus flowers using transient expression system. The transcriptome data and the flower-specific promoters screened in the present study will benefit fundamental research for improving the agronomic traits as well as disease and pest control in a tissue-specific manner.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Maize brown midrib (bm) mutants associated with impaired lignin biosynthesis are a potential source for the breed of novel germplasms with improved cell wall digestibility. The spontaneous bm5 mutants had been identified since 2008. However, the gene responsible for the bm5 locus, and the comprehensive effects of bm5 mutation on lignin biosynthesis, soluble phenolics accumulation, and cell wall degradation have yet to be elucidated.
RESULTS: The bm5 locus was identified to encode a major 4-coumarate: coenzyme A ligase (Zm4CL1) through analyzing MutMap-assisted gene mapping data. Two alleles of Zm4CL1 isolated from bm5 mutants contained two transposons inserted in the first exon and the second intron, respectively, and consequently, the activities of 4CLs in the crude enzyme extracts from bm5 midribs were reduced by 51-62\% compared with the wild type. Furthermore, five 4CLs were retrieved from maize genome, and Zm4CL1 was the most highly expressed one in the lignified tissues. Mutation of Zm4CL1 mainly impeded the biosynthesis of guaiacyl (G) lignins and increased the level of soluble feruloyl derivatives without impacting maize growth and development. Moreover, both neutral detergent fiber digestibility and saccharification efficiency of cell walls were significantly elevated in the bm5 mutant.
CONCLUSIONS: Zm4CL1 was identified as the Bm5 gene, since two independent alleles of Zm4CL1 were associated with the same mutant phenotype. Mutation of Zm4CL1 mainly affected G lignin biosynthesis and soluble feruloyl derivatives accumulation in maize lignified tissues. The reduced recalcitrance of the bm5 mutant suggests that Zm4CL1 is an elite target for cell wall engineering, and genetic manipulation of this gene will facilitate the utilization of crop straw and stover that have to be dealt with for environmental protection.},

	abstract = {Plant CCCH proteins participate in the control of multiple developmental and adaptive processes, but the regulatory mechanisms underlying these processes are not well known. In this study, we showed that the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) CCCH protein C3H15 negatively regulates cell elongation by inhibiting brassinosteroid (BR) signaling. Genetic and biochemical evidence showed that C3H15 functions downstream of the receptor BR INSENSITIVE 1 (BRI1) as a negative regulator in the BR pathway. C3H15 is phosphorylated by the GLYCOGEN SYNTHASE KINASE 3 -like kinase BR-INSENSITIVE 2 (BIN2) at Ser111 in the cytoplasm in the absence of BRs. Upon BR perception, C3H15 transcription is enhanced, and the phosphorylation of C3H15 by BIN2 is reduced. The dephosphorylated C3H15 protein accumulates in the nucleus, where C3H15 regulates transcription via G-rich elements (typically GGGAGA). C3H15 and BRASSINAZOLE RESISTANT 1 (BZR1)/BRI1-EMS-SUPPRESSOR 1 (BES1), two central transcriptional regulators of BR signaling, directly suppress each other and share a number of BR-responsive target genes. Moreover, C3H15 antagonizes BZR1 and BES1 to regulate the expression of their shared cell elongation-associated target gene, SMALL AUXIN-UP RNA 15 (SAUR15). This study demonstrates that C3H15-mediated BR signaling may be parallel to, or even attenuate, the dominant BZR1 and BES1 signaling pathways to control cell elongation. This finding expands our understanding of the regulatory mechanisms underlying BR-induced cell elongation in plants.},

Each haustorium is enveloped by an extrahaustorial membrane (EHM) derived from the host plasma membrane. Little is known about the EHM biogenesis and identity. Here, we demonstrate that among the two plasma membrane phosphoinositides in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), PI(4,5)P2 is dynamically up-regulated at powdery mildew infection sites and recruited to the EHM, whereas PI4P is absent in the EHM. Lateral transport of PI(4,5)P2 into the EHM occurs through a brefeldin A-insensitive but actin-dependent trafficking pathway. Furthermore, the lower levels of PI(4,5)P2 in pip5k1 pip5k2 mutants inhibit fungal pathogen development and cause disease resistance, independent of cell death-associated defenses and involving impaired host susceptibility. Our results reveal that plant biotrophic and hemibiotrophic pathogens modulate the subcellular distribution of host phosphoinositides and recruit PI(4,5)P2 as a susceptibility factor for plant disease.},

Previously, we constructed a T-DNA insertional library, and screened for many conidiation-deficient mutants from this library. Here, we report a T-DNA insertional mutant ZS-1T21882 that completely lost conidiation. In mutant ZS-1T21882, the T-DNA was integrated into a gene (CmPrat-1) which encodes phosphoribosylamidotransferase (PRAT, EC 2.4.2.14), an enzyme catalyzing the first committed step in de novo purine nucleotide synthesis. Gene replacement and complementation experiments confirmed that phosphoribosylamidotransferase is essential for conidiation of C. minitans. Mutant ZS-1T21882 did not grow on modified Czapek-Dox broth (MCD), but it grew well on MCD amended with IMP or AMP. The conidial production of this mutant was dependent on the dosage of IMP amended. At low concentrations, such as 0.1 mM and 0.25 mM, the mutant produced very few pycnidia, while up to 0.75 mM or higher, the conidiation of this mutant was restored completely. cAMP could not restore the conidiation of mutant ZS-1T21882 when amended into MCD, but could when amended into PDA. Neither GMP nor cGMP could restore the conidiation in MCD or in PDA. Our findings suggest that phosphoribosylamidotransferase is essential for conidiation of C. minitans via adenosine related molecules. Furthermore, when dual cultured with its host, this mutant produced conidia in the host mycelium and on the sclerotia of S. sclerotiorum, but not in dead mycelium or on dead sclerotia, suggesting that C. minitans is likely to able to obtain adenosine or related components from its host during parasitization.},

Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis can provide a more rapid and accurate assessment of petal infestation levels. Primers and a hydrolysis probe were designed to amplify a 70-bp region of an S. sclerotiorum-specific gene, SS1G\_00263. A hydrolysis probe-based qPCR assay was developed that had a detection limit of 8.0 × 10-4 ng of S. sclerotiorum DNA and only amplified S. sclerotiorum DNA. Evaluation of petals collected at five sampling points in each of 10 commercial canola fields on each of two sampling dates (corresponding to 20 to 30\% bloom and 40 to 50\% bloom) revealed S. sclerotiorum DNA infestation levels of 0 to 3.3 × 10-1 ng/petal. This qPCR assay can be used to reliably quantify petal infestation and, with further research, has the potential to serve as the basis for a Sclerotinia stem rot risk assessment tool or as a means to study Sclerotinia stem rot epidemiology.},

	abstract = {Epimedium brevicornum Maxim (EbM) is a perennial herb grown in China for traditional Chinese medicines. Grey mould symptoms were observed on EbM leaves in several fields in Hubei Province, China, from April to June in 2015, 2016 and 2017. V-shaped blights or concentric rings appeared initially on the basal leaves, followed by necrosis gradually spreading from the tips and margins to the entire leaf. Severely infected leaves were rolled or distorted and became brittle. A fungal isolate, MF468110, was recovered from diseased plants and identified as Botrytis cinerea based on its morphological features and sequence analysis of multiple genes. The colony on potato dextrose agar was initially white with abundant fluffy aerial mycelia and turned grey with numerous irregular black sclerotia. Sequence analysis of the G3PDH, RPB2 and HSP60 genes found high similarity with other reference strains representing the species B. cinerea. Pathogenicity tests showed that the symptoms were similar on EbM leaves after inoculation with a conidial suspension and the re-isolated fungi were morphologically similar to the isolates used for inoculation, indicating that the isolate MF468110 was pathogenic to EbM. This is the first report of B. cinerea causing grey mould on EbM in China.},

Clubroot resistance assay on European clubroot differentials (ECD) set revealed that ECD10 (Brassica napus) and ECD4 (Brassica rapa) show a complete resistance to the tested P. brassicae isolate in contrast to highly susceptible hosts Westar (B. napus) and ECD5 (B. rapa). Previously, we used fluorescent probe-based confocal microscopy (FCM) to refine the life cycle of P. brassicae and indicate the important time points during its infection in Arabidopsis. Here, we used FCM to systematically investigate the infection of P. brassicae in two resistant host species ECD10 and ECD4 and two non-host crops wheat and barley at each indicated time points, compared with two susceptible hosts Westar and ECD5. We found that P. brassicae can initiate the primary infection phase and produce uninucleate primary plasmodia in both resistant hosts and non-hosts just like susceptible hosts at 2 days post-inoculation (dpi). Importantly, P. brassicae can develop into zoosporangia and secondary zoospores and release the secondary zoospores from the zoosporangia in resistant hosts at 7 dpi, comparable to susceptible hosts. However, during the secondary infection phase, no secondary plasmodium was detected in the cortical cells of both resistant hosts in contrast to massive secondary plasmodia present in the cortex tissue of two susceptible hosts leading to root swelling at 15 dpi. In both non-host crops, only uninucleate primary plasmodia were observed throughout roots at 7 and 15 dpi. Quantitative PCR based on DNA revealed that the biomass of P. brassicae has no significant increase from 2 dpi in non-host plants and from 7 dpi in resistant host plants, compared to the huge biomass increase in susceptible host plants from 2 to 25 dpi. Our study reveals that the primary infection phase in the root epidermis and the secondary infection phase in the cortex tissue are, respectively, blocked in non-hosts and resistant hosts, contributing to understanding of cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying clubroot non-host and host resistance.},

	abstract = {Rice blast disease caused by Magnaporthe oryzae is initiated by the attachment of conidia to plant surfaces. Germ tubes emerging from conidia develop melanized appressoria to physically penetrate the host surface. Previous studies revealed that appressorium development requires the breakdown of storage lipids and glycogen that occur in peroxisomes and the cytosol respectively, culminating in production of pyruvate. However, the downstream product(s) entering the mitochondria for further oxidation is unclear. In this study, we aimed to investigate the molecular basis underlying the metabolic flux towards the mitochondria associated with the infectious-related development in M. oryzae. We showed that D-lactate is a key intermediate metabolite of the mobilization of lipids and glycogen, and its oxidative conversion to pyruvate is catalysed by a mitochondrial D-lactate dehydrogenase MoDLD1. Deletion of MoDLD1 caused defects in conidiogenesis and appressorium formation, and subsequently the loss of fungal pathogenicity. Further analyses demonstrated that MoDLD1 activity is involved in the maintenance of redox homeostasis during conidial germination. Thus, MoDLD1 is a critical modulator that channels metabolite flow to the mitochondrion coupling cellular redox state, and contributes to development and virulence of M. oryzae.},

	abstract = {The rapid reorganization and polarization of actin filaments (AFs) toward the pathogen penetration site is one of the earliest cellular responses, yet the regulatory mechanism of AF dynamics is poorly understood. Using live-cell imaging in Arabidopsis, we show that polarization coupled with AF bundling involves precise spatiotemporal control at the site of attempted penetration by the nonadapted barley powdery mildew fungus, Blumeria graminis f. sp. hordei (Bgh). We further show that the Bgh-triggered AF mobility and organelle aggregation are predominately driven by the myosin motor proteins. Inactivation of myosins by pharmacological inhibitors prevents bulk aggregation of organelles and blocks recruitment of lignin-like compounds to the penetration site and deposition of callose and defensive protein, PENETRATION 1 (PEN1) into the apoplastic papillae, resulting in attenuation of penetration resistance. Using gene knockout analysis, we demonstrate that highly expressed myosins XI, especially myosin XI-K, are the primary contributors to cell wall-mediated penetration resistance. Moreover, the quadruple myosin knockout mutant xi-1 xi-2 xi-i xi-k displays impaired trafficking pathway responsible for the accumulation of PEN1 at the cell periphery. Strikingly, this mutant shows not only increased penetration rate but also enhanced overall disease susceptibility to both adapted and nonadapted fungal pathogens. Our findings establish myosins XI as key regulators of plant antifungal immunity.},

This comprehensive dataset for seed development in tetraploid and ancestral diploid Brassicas provides new insights into evolutionary divergence and expression bias at the gene and subgenome levels during the domestication of these valued crop species. Comparisons of gene expression associated with regulatory networks and metabolic pathways operating in the embryo and seed coat during seed development reveal differences in storage reserve accumulation and fatty acid metabolism among the six Brassica species.

However, the evolution of AS and its influence on grain development in diploid grass and valuable polyploid wheat crops are poorly understood. To address this knowledge gap, we developed a pipeline for the analysis of alternatively spliced transcript isoforms, which takes the high sequence similarity among polyploid wheat subgenomes into account. Through analysis of synteny and detection of collinearity of homoeologous subgenomes, conserved and specific AS events across five wheat and grass species were identified. A global analysis of the regulation of AS in diploid grass and polyploid wheat grains revealed diversity in AS events not only between the endosperm, pericarp and embryo overdevelopment, but also between subgenomes. Analysis of AS in homoeologous triads of polyploid wheats revealed evolutionary divergence between gene-level and transcript-level regulation of embryogenesis. Evolutionary age analysis indicated that the generation of novel transcript isoforms has occurred in young genes at a more rapid rate than in ancient genes. These findings, together with the development of comprehensive AS resources for wheat and grass species, advance understanding of the evolution of regulatory features of AS during embryogenesis and grain development in wheat.},

A ubiquitin (Ub) chain can be linked through one of the seven lysine (K) residues or the N-terminus methionine of the Ub, and the Ub-conjugating enzymes called E2s play a critical role in determining the linkage specificity of Ub chains. Further, while K48-linked polyubiquitin chain is important for protein degradation, much less is known about the functions of other types of polyubiquitin chains in plants. We showed previously that UBC22 is unique in its ability to catalyze K11-dependent Ub dimer formation in vitro and ubc22 knockout mutants had defects in megasporogenesis. In this study, further analyses of the Arabidopsis ubc22 mutants revealed four subtypes of plants based on the phenotypic changes in vegetative growth. These four subtypes appeared consistently in the plants of three independent ubc22 mutants. Transcriptomic analysis showed that transcript levels of genes related to several pathways were altered differently in different subtypes of mutant plants. In one subtype, the mutant plants had increased expression of genes related to plant defenses and showed enhanced resistance to a necrotrophic plant pathogen. These results suggest multiple functions of UBC22 during plant development and stress response.},

	abstract = {Systemic fungicides and antifungals are used as frontline treatments for fungal diseases in plants and humans. It is generally accepted that fungicides will bring significant negative side-effects to the environment and result in fungicide resistance in the pathogenic fungi. Although previous research has focused on fungicide application rates and fungal resistance for a long time, little attention has been paid to fungicide residues after treatment, especially their potential role in fungal growth and sporulation. Here we investigated the effect of fungicides at sublethal concentrations on fungal sporulation. The results showed that two kinds of 14α-demethylase inhibitors (DMIs) fungicides increased the number of isolates of Colletotrichum spp. to sporulate on PDA. Both on PDA medium and plant tissue, low concentration of DMI fungicides could promote spore production of Colletotrichum spp., whereas pyraclostrobin, a quinone outside inhibitor (QoIs), had no significant effects on sporulation of Colletotrichum spp. Transcriptomic analysis suggested that the DMIs fungicide stress signal may be transmitted to the central regulatory pathway through the FluG-mediated signalling pathway, and further confirmed the morphological effect of DMI fungicide on promoting sporulation of Colletotrichum. To our knowledge, this is the first study to provide insights into the reproductive response of fungi in response to fungicide stress. Our findings indicate that fungicides have two-way effects on the growth and reproduction of pathogenic fungi and provide a new basis for the scientific and rational use of fungicides.},

Water loss was profiled in a pure pectin system and in vivo. While calcium and boron reduced water loss in pure pectin standards, the impact on Allium species was insignificant (p {\textgreater} 0.05). Nevertheless, synchrotron X-ray microscopy showed the localization of exogenously applied calcium to the apoplast in the epidermal cells of Allium fistulosum. Exogenous calcium application increased viscosity and resistance to shear force in Allium fistulosum, suggesting the formation of calcium cross-linkages ("egg-box" structures). Moreover, Allium fistulosum (freezing tolerant) was also more tolerant to dehydration stress compared to Allium cepa (freezing sensitive). Furthermore, the addition of boric acid (H3BO3) to pure pectin reduced water loss and increased viscosity, which indicates the formation of RG-II dimers. The Arabidopsis boron transport mutant, bor1, expressed greater water loss and, based on the lesion area of leaf tissue, a greater susceptibility to Colletotrichum higginsianum and Botrytis cinerea. While pectin modifications in the cell wall are likely not the sole solution to dehydration and biotic stress resistance, they appear to play an important role against multiple stresses.},

Previous rice metabolism studies have largely focused on identifying genes controlling major effect loci. To complement these studies, we conducted a replicated metabolomics analysis on a japonica (Lemont) by indica (Teqing) rice recombinant inbred line population and focused on the genetic variation for primary metabolism. Using independent replicated studies, we show that in contrast to other rice studies, the heritability of primary metabolism is similar to Arabidopsis. The vast majority of metabolic QTLs had small to moderate effects with significant polygenic epistasis. Two metabolomics QTL hotspots had opposing effects on carbon and nitrogen rich metabolites suggesting that they may influence carbon and nitrogen partitioning, with one locus co-localizing with SUSIBA2 (WRKY78). Comparing QTLs for metabolomic and a variety of growth related traits identified few overlaps. Interestingly, the rice population displayed fewer loci controlling stochastic variation for metabolism than was found in Arabidopsis. Thus, it is possible that domestication has differentially impacted stochastic metabolite variation more than average metabolite variation.},

Little is known about the regulation of GSL accumulation in the leaves. We quantified the levels of 9 different GSLs and 15 related traits in the leaves of 366 accessions and found that the seed and leaf GSL content were highly correlated (r = 0.79). A total of 78 loci were associated with GSL traits, and five common and eleven tissue-specific associated loci were related to total leaf and seed GSL content. Thirty-six candidate genes were inferred to be involved in GSL biosynthesis. The candidate gene BnaA03g40190D (BnaA3.MYB28) was validated by DNA polymorphisms and gene expression analysis. This gene was responsible for high leaf/low seed GSL content and could explain 30.62\% of the total leaf GSL variation in the low seed GSL panel and was not fixed during double-low rapeseed breeding.

High WUE in the vegetative phase was associated with low seed yield.

RNA sequencing was performed to determine the expression of candidate genes underlying Δ13 C QTL. QTL contributing to main and QTL × environment interaction effects for Δ13 C and yield were identified. One multiple-trait QTL for Δ13 C, days to flower, plant height, and seed yield was identified on chromosome A09. Interestingly, this QTL region overlapped with a homoeologous exchange (HE) event, suggesting its association with the multiple traits. Transcriptome analysis revealed 121 significantly differentially expressed genes underlying Δ13 C QTL on A09 and C09, including in HE regions.

Brassica napus is an ideal model species for investigating polyploid genome evolution. The present study comprehensively analyzed DNA and RNA variation of two representative B. napus inbredlines, Zhongshuang11 and Zhongyou821, and we investigated gene expression levels of An and Cn subgenomes in multiple tissues of the two lines. The distribution of transmitted single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) was significantly different in two subgenomes of B. napus. Gene expression levels were significantly negatively correlated with number of variations in replication and transcription of the corresponding genes, but were positively correlated with the ratios of transmitted SNPs from DNA to RNA. We found a higher density of SNP variation in An than that in Cn during DNA replication and more SNPs were transmitted to RNA during transcription, which may contribute to An expression dominance. These activities resulted in asymmetrical gene expression in polyploid B. napus. The SNPs transmitted from DNA to RNA could be an important complement feature in comparative genomics, and they may play important roles in asymmetrical genome evolution in polyploidy.},

	abstract = {Optimizing the profile and quantity of fatty acids in rapeseed (Brassica napus L.) is critical for maximizing the value of edible oil and biodiesel. However, selection of these complex seed quality traits is difficult before haplotypes controlling their contents are identified. To efficiently identify genetic loci influencing these traits and underlying candidate genes and networks, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of eight seed quality traits (oil and protein content, palmitic, stearic, oleic, linoleic, eicosenoic and erucic acids content). The GWAS population comprised 370 diverse accessions, which were phenotyped in five environments and genotyped using 60K SNP arrays. The results indicated that oil and protein contents generally showed negative correlations, while fatty acid contents showed positive or negative correlations, with palmitic and erucic acid contents directly affecting oil content. Seven SNPs on five chromosomes were associated with both seed oil and protein content, and five genes orthologous to genes in Arabidopsis thaliana were predicted as candidates. From resequencing data, besides known haplotypes in BnaA.FAE1.a and BnaC.FAE1.a, three accessions harboring a new haplotype conferring moderate erucic acid content were identified. Interestingly, in a haplotype block, one haplotype was associated with high palmitic acid content and low oil content, while the others showed the reverse effects. This finding was consistent with a negative correlation between palmitic acid and oil contents, suggesting historical selection for high oil content. The identification by this study of genetic variation and complex correlations of eight seed quality traits may be beneficial for crop selection strategies.},

Glucosinolates (GSLs) are an important group of secondary metabolites characteristic of the Brassicales order, whose degradation products are proving to be increasingly important in plant protection. Enhancing the defense effect of GSL and their associated degradation products is an attractive strategy to strengthen the resistance of plants by transgenic approaches. We generated the lines of Brassica napus with three biosynthesis genes involved in GSL metabolic pathway (BnMAM1, BnCYP83A1 and BnUGT74B1), respectively. We then measured the foliar GSLs of each transgenic lines and inoculated them with S. sclerotiorum and B. cinerea. Compared with the wild type control, over-expressing BnUGT74B1 in B. napus increased the aliphatic and indolic GSL levels by 1.7 and 1.5 folds in leaves respectively; while over-expressing BnMAM1 or BnCYP83A1 resulted in an approximate 1.5-fold higher only in the aliphatic GSL level in leaves. The results of plant inoculation demonstrated that BnUGT74B1-overexpressing lines showed less severe disease symptoms and tissue damage compared with the wild type control, but BnMAM1 or BnCYP83A1-overexpressing lines showed no significant difference in comparison to the controls. These results suggest that the resistance to S. sclerotiorum and B. cinerea in B. napus could be enhanced through tailoring the GSL profiles by transgenic approaches or molecular breeding, which provides useful information to assist plant breeders to design improved breeding strategies.},

However, it is not clear whether the transcription factors (TFs) regulating these new enzyme encoding genes were required to co-evolve with these genes in a similar fashion or if these new genes can be captured by existing conserved TFs to provide the appropriate expression pattern. In this study, we found two conserved TFs, MYB115, and MYB118, co-expressed with the key enzyme encoding genes in the newly evolved benzoyloxy glucosinolate (GLS) pathway. These TFs interacted with the promoters of the GLS biosynthetic genes and negatively influenced their expression. Similarly, the GLS profiles of these two TFs knockouts showed that they influenced the aliphatic GLS accumulation within seed, leaf and flower, while they mainly expressed in seeds. Further studies indicated that they are functionally redundant and epistatically interact to control the transcription of GLS genes. Complementation study confirmed their roles in regulating the aliphatic GLS biosynthesis. These results suggest that the newly evolved enzyme encoding genes for novel metabolites can be regulated by conserved TFs, which helps to improve our model for newly evolved genes regulation.},

	abstract = {The proteins of membrane transporters (MTs) are embedded within membrane-bounded organelles and are the prime targets for improvements in the efficiency of water and nutrient transportation. Their function is to maintain cellular homeostasis by controlling ionic movements across cellular channels from roots to upper plant parts, xylem loading and remobilization of sugar molecules from photosynthesis tissues in the leaf (source) to roots, stem and seeds (sink) via phloem loading. The plant’s entire source-to-sink relationship is regulated by multiple transporting proteins in a highly sophisticated manner and driven based on different stages of plant growth and development (PG\&D) and environmental changes. The MTs play a pivotal role in PG\&D in terms of increased plant height, branches/tiller numbers, enhanced numbers, length and filled panicles per plant, seed yield and grain quality. Dynamic climatic changes disturbed ionic balance (salt, drought and heavy metals) and sugar supply (cold and heat stress) in plants. Due to poor selectivity, some of the MTs also uptake toxic elements in roots negatively impact PG\&D and are later on also exported to upper parts where they deteriorate grain quality. As an adaptive strategy, in response to salt and heavy metals, plants activate plasma membranes and vacuolar membrane-localized MTs that export toxic elements into vacuole and also translocate in the root’s tips and shoot. However, in case of drought, cold and heat stresses, MTs increased water and sugar supplies to all organs. In this review, we mainly review recent literature from Arabidopsis, halophytes and major field crops such as rice, wheat, maize and oilseed rape in order to argue the global role of MTs in PG\&D, and abiotic stress tolerance. We also discussed gene expression level changes and genomic variations within a species as well as within a family in response to developmental and environmental cues.},

	abstract = {Transposable elements (TEs) represent a major and variable portion of plant genomes, and recent progress in genetics and genomics has highlighted the importance of different TE species as a useful genetic tool in crop breeding. TEs can cause changes in the pattern of gene expression, and regulate gene function by various means such as cis- up- or down-regulation of nearby genes through insertion at promoter, intron, exon and down-stream regions, and trans-production of short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) via two RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) pathways. siRNAs generated through different RdDM pathways differ in length and have variable effects on TEs. For instance, noncoding siRNAs of 20–60 nt produced by RNA polymerase IV (dicer-independent) and 21/22 nt by Pol II (dicer-dependent) have only minor effects on TEs compared with 24 nt siRNAs produced by Pol IV (dicer-dependent pathways). Following whole-genome duplication (WGD) events after polyploidization in allopolyploids, TEs from either parent are able to induce siRNAs to regulate the complex polyploid genome. Those designated as ‘controllers’ usually reside in the dominant parent and affect the TEs of the recessive parent. Subgenome cross-talk thus appears to contribute to epigenetic regulation as well as reshuffling or restructuring of subgenomes and creation of novel patterns of genes expression/and variation in local or global copy number. In this review, we focus on recent progress in unraveling the role of TEs in gene expression regulation via TE-derived siRNAs in the context of polyploid plant evolution and environmental stress, and explore how ancient WGD and recent polyploidy affected the evolution of TE-induced epigenetic mechanisms.},

For plant breeding, screening of Sclerotinia resistance genes is important. Most F-box genes participated in plant defense response, and LRR regarded as the important domain of resistant genes. Thereby, F-box genes were investigated in this study. Genome-wide identification of F-box-LRR gene in B. napus was conducted by bioinformatics method. Based on published data of tissue expression in Zhongshuang 11 and transcriptome data of inoculation fungi on leaves of susceptible Westar and resistant Zhongyou 821, corresponding Bn-F-box-LRR genes were identified and then verified by qRT-PCR. 161 BnF-box-LRR genes were found and classified into 4 subgroups （FBXLRR1 to FBXLRR4）. The fourth subgroup, FBXLRR4, was significantly different from the other three in the conserved protein distribution and gene structure. It was clustered into the same clade with the homologous genes which involved in plant stress resistance in Arabidopsis thaliana. Therefore, it is speculated that this subgroup might be mainly involved in plant stress response. Based on transcriptome data, it was found that most FBXLRR4 genes were highly expressed in root and leaves, and showed significant expression alternation after S.sclerotiorum induction, indicating these genes potentially in Sclerotinia disease resistant.},
