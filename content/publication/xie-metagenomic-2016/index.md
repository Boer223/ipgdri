abstract: Microcystis bloom, a cyanobacterial mass occurrence often found in eutrophicated
  water bodies, is one of the most serious threats to freshwater ecosystems worldwide.
  In nature, Microcystis forms aggregates or colonies that contain heterotrophic bacteria.
  The Microcystis-bacteria colonies were persistent even when they were maintained
  in lab culture for a long period. The relationship between Microcystis and the associated
  bacteria was investigated by a metagenomic approach in this study. We developed
  a visualization-guided method of binning for genome assembly after total colony
  DNA sequencing. We found that the method was effective in grouping sequences and
  it did not require reference genome sequence. Individual genomes of the colony bacteria
  were obtained and they provided valuable insights into microbial community structures.
  Analysis of metabolic pathways based on these genomes revealed that while all heterotrophic
  bacteria were dependent upon Microcystis for carbon and energy, Vitamin B12 biosynthesis,
  which is required for growth by Microcystis, was accomplished in a cooperative fashion
  among the bacteria. Our analysis also suggests that individual bacteria in the colony
  community contributed a complete pathway for degradation of benzoate, which is inhibitory
  to the cyanobacterial growth, and its ecological implication for Microcystis bloom
  is discussed.
