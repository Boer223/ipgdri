abstract: A novel BnERF50 gene was identified from transcription cDNA chip of Zhongshuang
  9（Brassica napus L.） against Sclerotinia sclerotiorum infection.BLAST result showed
  BnERF50 protein has a typical and conserved ERF（ethylene response factor） domain
  which belongs to ERF family.The expression of BnERF50 was up-regulated significantly
  at 24h after S.sclerotiorum inoculation on B.napus.Over-expression of BnERF50 in
  transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana activated the expressions of pathogenesis-related（PR）
  genes PDF1.2 and ChiB,and it also significantly enhanced the plant resistance to
  the necrotrophic fungi S.sclerotiorum.
