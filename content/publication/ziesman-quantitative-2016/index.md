abstract: Sclerotinia stem rot, caused by Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, is an economically
  important disease of canola (Brassica napus) commonly managed by routine application
  of fungicides. Petal infestation has been demonstrated to be an important stage
  of the disease cycle in canola and has been the focus of previously developed Sclerotinia
  stem rot risk assessment methods. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)
  analysis can provide a more rapid and accurate assessment of petal infestation levels.
  Primers and a hydrolysis probe were designed to amplify a 70-bp region of an S.
  sclerotiorum-specific gene, SS1G_00263. A hydrolysis probe-based qPCR assay was
  developed that had a detection limit of 8.0 × 10-4 ng of S. sclerotiorum DNA and
  only amplified S. sclerotiorum DNA. Evaluation of petals collected at five sampling
  points in each of 10 commercial canola fields on each of two sampling dates (corresponding
  to 20 to 30% bloom and 40 to 50% bloom) revealed S. sclerotiorum DNA infestation
  levels of 0 to 3.3 × 10-1 ng/petal. This qPCR assay can be used to reliably quantify
  petal infestation and, with further research, has the potential to serve as the
  basis for a Sclerotinia stem rot risk assessment tool or as a means to study Sclerotinia
  stem rot epidemiology.
