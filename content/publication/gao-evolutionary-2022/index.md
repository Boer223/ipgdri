abstract: The economically valuable Brassica species include the six related members
  of U's Triangle. Despite the agronomic and economic importance of these Brassicas,
  the impacts of evolution and relatively recent domestication events on the genetic
  landscape of seed development have not been comprehensively examined in these species.
  Here we present a 3D transcriptome atlas for the six species of U's Triangle, producing
  a unique resource that captures gene expression data for the major subcompartments
  of the seed, from the unfertilized ovule to the mature embryo and seed coat. This
  comprehensive dataset for seed development in tetraploid and ancestral diploid Brassicas
  provides new insights into evolutionary divergence and expression bias at the gene
  and subgenome levels during the domestication of these valued crop species. Comparisons
  of gene expression associated with regulatory networks and metabolic pathways operating
  in the embryo and seed coat during seed development reveal differences in storage
  reserve accumulation and fatty acid metabolism among the six Brassica species. This
  study illustrates the genetic underpinnings of seed traits and the selective pressures
  placed on seed production, providing an immense resource for continued investigation
  of Brassica polyploid biology, genomics and evolution.
