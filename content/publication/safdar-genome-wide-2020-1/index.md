abstract: 'Potassium use efficiency, a complex trait, directly impacts the yield potential
  of crop plants. Low potassium efficiency leads to a high use of fertilizers, which
  is not only farmer unfriendly but also deteriorates the environment. Genome-wide
  association studies (GWAS) are widely used to dissect complex traits. However, most
  studies use single-locus one-dimensional GWAS models which do not provide true information
  about complex traits that are controlled by multiple loci. Here, both single-locus
  GWAS (MLM) and multi-locus GWAS (pLARmEB, FASTmrMLM, mrMLM, FASTmrEMMA) models were
  used with genotyping from 90 K Infinium SNP array and phenotype derived from four
  normal and potassium-stress environments, which identified 534 significant marker-trait
  associations (MTA) for agronomic and potassium related traits: pLARmEB = 279, FASTmrMLM
  = 213, mrMLM = 35, MLM = 6, FASTmrEMMA = 1. Further screening of these MTA led to
  the detection of eleven stable loci: q1A, q1D, q2B-1, q2B-2, q2D, q4D, q5B-1, q5B-2,
  q5B-3, q6D, and q7A. Moreover, Meta-QTL (MQTL) analysis of four independent QTL
  studies for potassium deficiency in bread wheat located 16 MQTL on 13 chromosomes.
  One locus identified in this study (q5B-1) colocalized with an MQTL (MQTL_11 ),
  while the other ten loci were novel associations. Gene ontology of these loci identified
  20 putative candidate genes encoding functional proteins involved in key pathways
  related to stress tolerance, sugar metabolism, and nutrient transport. These findings
  provide potential targets for breeding potassium stress resistant wheat cultivars
  and advocate the advantages of multi-locus GWAS models for studying complex traits.'
