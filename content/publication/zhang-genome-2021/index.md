abstract: Sclerotinia sclerotiorum is a notorious fungal pathogen that causes sclerotinia
  stem rot (SSR) on many important crops in China and worldwide. Here, we present
  a high-quality genome assembly of S. sclerotiorum strain WH6 using the PacBio SMRT
  cell platform. The assembled genome has a total size of 38.96 Mbp, with a contig
  N50 length of 1.90 Mbp, and encodes 10,512 predicted coding genes, including 685
  secreted proteins and 65 effector candidates. This is the first report of a S. sclerotiorum
  genome sequence from China. The WH6 genome sequence provides a valuable resource
  for facilitating our understanding of S. sclerotiorum-host interactions and SSR
  control in China and the world.
