abstract: Sclerotinia sclerotiorum causes a highly destructive disease in oilseed
  rape (Brassica napus) resulting in significant economic losses. Studies on the Arabidopsis
  thaliana MPK4 loss-of-function mutant have implicated that AtMPK4 is involved in
  plant defense regulation, and its effect on disease resistance varies in different
  plant-pathogen interactions. In this study, we isolated a B. napus mitogen-activated
  protein kinase, BnMPK4, and found that BnMPK4 along with PDF1.2 are inducible in
  resistant line Zhongshuang9 but both are consistently suppressed in susceptible
  line 84039 after inoculation with S. sclerotiorum. Transgenic oilseed rape overexpressing
  BnMPK4 markedly enhances resistance to S. sclerotiorum and Botrytis cinerea. Further
  experiments showed that transgenic plants inhibited growth of S. sclerotiorum and
  constitutively activated PDF1.2 but decreased H2O2 production and constitutively
  suppressed PR-1 expression. Treatment of roots of the transgenic plants with H2O2
  solution resulted in enhanced susceptibility to the two pathogens. Our results support
  the idea that MPK4 positively regulates jasmonic acid-mediated defense response,
  which might play an important role in resistance to S. sclerotiorum in oilseed rape.
