abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Sesame, Sesamum indicum L., is considered the queen of oilseeds
  for its high oil content and quality, and is grown widely in tropical and subtropical
  areas as an important source of oil and protein. However, the molecular biology
  of sesame is largely unexplored. RESULTS: Here, we report a high-quality genome
  sequence of sesame assembled de novo with a contig N50 of 52.2 kb and a scaffold
  N50 of 2.1 Mb, containing an estimated 27,148 genes. The results reveal novel, independent
  whole genome duplication and the absence of the Toll/interleukin-1 receptor domain
  in resistance genes. Candidate genes and oil biosynthetic pathways contributing
  to high oil content were discovered by comparative genomic and transcriptomic analyses.
  These revealed the expansion of type 1 lipid transfer genes by tandem duplication,
  the contraction of lipid degradation genes, and the differential expression of essential
  genes in the triacylglycerol biosynthesis pathway, particularly in the early stage
  of seed development. Resequencing data in 29 sesame accessions from 12 countries
  suggested that the high genetic diversity of lipid-related genes might be associated
  with the wide variation in oil content. Additionally, the results shed light on
  the pivotal stage of seed development, oil accumulation and potential key genes
  for sesamin production, an important pharmacological constituent of sesame. CONCLUSIONS:
  As an important species from the order Lamiales and a high oil crop, the sesame
  genome will facilitate future research on the evolution of eudicots, as well as
  the study of lipid biosynthesis and potential genetic improvement of sesame.'
