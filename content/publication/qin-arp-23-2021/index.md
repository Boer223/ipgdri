abstract: The actin cytoskeleton regulates an array of diverse cellular activities
  that support the establishment of plant-microbe interactions and plays a critical
  role in the execution of plant immunity. However, molecular and cellular mechanisms
  regulating the assembly and rearrangement of actin filaments (AFs) at plant-pathogen
  interaction sites remain largely elusive. Here, using live-cell imaging, we show
  that one of the earliest cellular responses in Arabidopsis thaliana upon powdery
  mildew attack is the formation of patch-like AF structures beneath fungal invasion
  sites. The AFs constituting actin patches undergo rapid turnover, which is regulated
  by the actin-related protein (ARP)2/3 complex and its activator, the WAVE/SCAR regulatory
  complex (W/SRC). The focal accumulation of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate
  at fungal penetration sites appears to be a crucial upstream modulator of the W/SRC-ARP2/3
  pathway-mediated actin patch formation. Knockout of W/SRC-ARP2/3 pathway subunits
  partially compromised penetration resistance with impaired endocytic recycling of
  the defense-associated t-SNARE protein PEN1 and its deposition into apoplastic papillae.
  Simultaneously knocking out ARP3 and knocking down the Class I formin (AtFH1) abolished
  actin patch formation, severely impaired the deposition of cell wall appositions,
  and promoted powdery mildew entry into host cells. Our results demonstrate that
  the ARP2/3 complex and formins, two actin-nucleating systems, act cooperatively
  and contribute to Arabidopsis penetration resistance to fungal invasion.
