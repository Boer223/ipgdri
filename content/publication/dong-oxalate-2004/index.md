abstract: In this study, we used OXO-active wheat germin and Aspergillus niger (A.
  niger) GO genes as exogenous genes and pBI121 as the basis to construct a GO/OXO
  double gene plant expression vector, and used cotyledons as explants to transform
  kale type oilseed rape by Agrobacterium-mediated genetic transformation to obtain
  engineered plants with improved disease resistance traits.
