abstract: Rape seedlings were fed 14 C oxalate through roots. The organic substances
  in leaves were extracted by acetic acid ethanol solution and were fractionated by
  chemical and chromatographic methods. It’s found from autoradiographic profile of
  seedlings that radioactivity in resistant varieties to Sclerotinia sclerotiorum
  was mainly confined to major veins of leaves and stems, whereas in susceptible varieties
  radioactivity was distributed rather uniformly throughout the seedlings. More than
  57% of oxalate （OA） absorbed was metabolized into other organic substances. And
  the higher rate of its metabolism was found in resistant varieties than that in
  susceptible ones. Radioactivity in soluble OA was about 1.2% of the total in leaves
  and more than 28% in insoluble OA. In the acetic acid ethanol fraction, radioactive
  neutral substances （mainly sugars） accounted for 43.2%～81.1%. OA induced increase
  of peroxidase activity, and the increase in resistant varieties was more than that
  in susceptible ones. The activities were positively correlated with resistant levels
  of varieties. The experiments with leaves extracts and the purified found that OA
  inhibited activities of polyphenoloxidase and phenylalanine ammonia lyase, but the
  OA concentrations required for the inhibition of both enzymes were different.
