abstract: The evolution of plant metabolic diversity is largely driven by gene duplication
  and ensuing sub-functionalization and/or neo-functionalization to generate new enzymatic
  activities. However, it is not clear whether the transcription factors (TFs) regulating
  these new enzyme encoding genes were required to co-evolve with these genes in a
  similar fashion or if these new genes can be captured by existing conserved TFs
  to provide the appropriate expression pattern. In this study, we found two conserved
  TFs, MYB115, and MYB118, co-expressed with the key enzyme encoding genes in the
  newly evolved benzoyloxy glucosinolate (GLS) pathway. These TFs interacted with
  the promoters of the GLS biosynthetic genes and negatively influenced their expression.
  Similarly, the GLS profiles of these two TFs knockouts showed that they influenced
  the aliphatic GLS accumulation within seed, leaf and flower, while they mainly expressed
  in seeds. Further studies indicated that they are functionally redundant and epistatically
  interact to control the transcription of GLS genes. Complementation study confirmed
  their roles in regulating the aliphatic GLS biosynthesis. These results suggest
  that the newly evolved enzyme encoding genes for novel metabolites can be regulated
  by conserved TFs, which helps to improve our model for newly evolved genes regulation.
