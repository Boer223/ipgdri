abstract: Plant CCCH proteins participate in the control of multiple developmental
  and adaptive processes, but the regulatory mechanisms underlying these processes
  are not well known. In this study, we showed that the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana)
  CCCH protein C3H15 negatively regulates cell elongation by inhibiting brassinosteroid
  (BR) signaling. Genetic and biochemical evidence showed that C3H15 functions downstream
  of the receptor BR INSENSITIVE 1 (BRI1) as a negative regulator in the BR pathway.
  C3H15 is phosphorylated by the GLYCOGEN SYNTHASE KINASE 3 -like kinase BR-INSENSITIVE
  2 (BIN2) at Ser111 in the cytoplasm in the absence of BRs. Upon BR perception, C3H15
  transcription is enhanced, and the phosphorylation of C3H15 by BIN2 is reduced.
  The dephosphorylated C3H15 protein accumulates in the nucleus, where C3H15 regulates
  transcription via G-rich elements (typically GGGAGA). C3H15 and BRASSINAZOLE RESISTANT
  1 (BZR1)/BRI1-EMS-SUPPRESSOR 1 (BES1), two central transcriptional regulators of
  BR signaling, directly suppress each other and share a number of BR-responsive target
  genes. Moreover, C3H15 antagonizes BZR1 and BES1 to regulate the expression of their
  shared cell elongation-associated target gene, SMALL AUXIN-UP RNA 15 (SAUR15). This
  study demonstrates that C3H15-mediated BR signaling may be parallel to, or even
  attenuate, the dominant BZR1 and BES1 signaling pathways to control cell elongation.
  This finding expands our understanding of the regulatory mechanisms underlying BR-induced
  cell elongation in plants.
