abstract: The marked increase in plant genomic data has provided valuable resources
  for investigating the dynamic evolution of duplicate genes in polyploidy. Brassica
  napus is an ideal model species for investigating polyploid genome evolution. The
  present study comprehensively analyzed DNA and RNA variation of two representative
  B. napus inbredlines, Zhongshuang11 and Zhongyou821, and we investigated gene expression
  levels of An and Cn subgenomes in multiple tissues of the two lines. The distribution
  of transmitted single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) was significantly different
  in two subgenomes of B. napus. Gene expression levels were significantly negatively
  correlated with number of variations in replication and transcription of the corresponding
  genes, but were positively correlated with the ratios of transmitted SNPs from DNA
  to RNA. We found a higher density of SNP variation in An than that in Cn during
  DNA replication and more SNPs were transmitted to RNA during transcription, which
  may contribute to An expression dominance. These activities resulted in asymmetrical
  gene expression in polyploid B. napus. The SNPs transmitted from DNA to RNA could
  be an important complement feature in comparative genomics, and they may play important
  roles in asymmetrical genome evolution in polyploidy.
