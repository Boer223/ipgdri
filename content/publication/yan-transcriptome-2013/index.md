abstract: 'BACKGROUND: The fertile and sterile plants were derived from the self-pollinated
  offspring of the F1 hybrid between the novel restorer line NR1 and the Nsa CMS line
  in Brassica napus. To elucidate gene expression and regulation caused by the A and
  C subgenomes of B. napus, as well as the alien chromosome and cytoplasm from Sinapis
  arvensis during the development of young floral buds, we performed a genome-wide
  high-throughput transcriptomic sequencing for young floral buds of sterile and fertile
  plants. RESULTS: In this study, equal amounts of total RNAs taken from young floral
  buds of sterile and fertile plants were sequenced using the Illumina/Solexa platform.
  After filtered out low quality data, a total of 2,760,574 and 2,714,441 clean tags
  were remained in the two libraries, from which 242,163 (Ste) and 253,507 (Fer) distinct
  tags were obtained. All distinct sequencing tags were annotated using all possible
  CATG+17-nt sequences of the genome and transcriptome of Brassica rapa and those
  of Brassica oleracea as the reference sequences, respectively. In total, 3231 genes
  of B. rapa and 3371 genes of B. oleracea were detected with significant differential
  expression levels. GO and pathway-based analyses were performed to determine and
  further to understand the biological functions of those differentially expressed
  genes (DEGs). In addition, there were 1089 specially expressed unknown tags in Fer,
  which were neither mapped to B. oleracea nor to B. rapa, and these unique tags were
  presumed to arise basically from the added alien chromosome of S. arvensis. Fifteen
  genes were randomly selected and their expression levels were confirmed by quantitative
  RT-PCR, and fourteen of them showed consistent expression patterns with the digital
  gene expression (DGE) data. CONCLUSIONS: A number of genes were differentially expressed
  between the young floral buds of sterile and fertile plants. Some of these genes
  may be candidates for future research on CMS in Nsa line, fertility restoration
  and improved agronomic traits in NR1 line. Further study of the unknown tags which
  were specifically expressed in Fer will help to explore desirable agronomic traits
  from wild species.'
