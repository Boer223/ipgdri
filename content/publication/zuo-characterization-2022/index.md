abstract: In plants, phloem is not only a vital structure that is used for nutrient
  transportation, but it is also the location of a response that defends against various
  stresses, named phloem-based defense (PBD). Phloem proteins (PP2s) are among the
  predominant proteins in phloem, indicating their potential functional role in PBD.
  Sclerotinia disease (SD), which is caused by the necrotrophic fungal pathogen S.
  sclerotiorum (Sclerotinia sclerotiorum), is a devastating disease that affects oil
  crops, especially Brassica napus (B. napus), mainly by blocking nutrition and water
  transportation through xylem and phloem. Presently, the role of PP2s in SD resistance
  is still largely estimated. Therefore, in this study, we identified 62 members of
  the PP2 gene family in the B. napus genome with an uneven distribution across the
  19 chromosomes. A phylogenetic analysis classified the BnPP2s into four clusters
  (I-IV), with cluster I containing the most members (28 genes) as a consequence of
  its frequent genome segmental duplication. A comparison of the gene structures and
  conserved motifs suggested that BnPP2 genes were well conserved in clusters II to
  IV, but were variable in cluster I. Interestingly, the motifs in different clusters
  displayed unique features, such as motif 6 specifically existing in cluster III
  and motif 1 being excluded from cluster IV. These results indicated the possible
  functional specification of BnPP2s. A transcriptome data analysis showed that the
  genes in clusters II to IV exhibited dynamic expression alternation in tissues and
  the stimulation of S. sclerotiorum, suggesting that they could participate in SD
  resistance. A GWAS analysis of a rapeseed population comprising 324 accessions identified
  four BnPP2 genes that were potentially responsible for SD resistance and a transgenic
  study that was conducted by transiently expressing BnPP2-6 in tobacco (Nicotiana
  tabacum) leaves validated their positive role in regulating SD resistance in terms
  of reduced lesion size after inoculation with S. sclerotiorum hyphal plugs. This
  study provides useful information on PP2 gene functions in B. napus and could aid
  elaborated functional studies on the PP2 gene family.
