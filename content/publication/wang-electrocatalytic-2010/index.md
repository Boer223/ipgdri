abstract: Salicylic acid (SA) is a biological substance that acts as a phytohormone
  and plays an important role in signal transduction in plants. It is important to
  accurately and sensitively detect SA levels. A gold electrode modified with copper
  nanoparticles was used to assay the electrocatalytic oxidation of salicylic acid.
  It was found that the electrochemical behavior of salicylic acid was greatly improved
  at copper nanoparticles, indicating that anodic oxidation could be catalyzed at
  copper nanoparticles. And the pH had remarkable effect on the electrochemical process,
  a very well-defined oxidation peak appeared at pH 13.3 (0.2M NaOH). The kinetics
  parameters of this process were calculated and the heterogeneous electron transfer
  rate constant (k) was determined to be 1.34x10(-3)cms(-1), and (1-alpha)n(alpha)
  was 1.22. The gold electrode modified with copper nanoparticles could detect SA
  at a higher sensitivity than common electrodes. The electrode was used to detect
  the SA levels in oilseed rape infected with the fungal pathogen Sclerotinia sclerotiorum.
  The results showed that the SA concentration reached a maximum during the 10th-25th
  hours after infection. This result was very similar to that determined by HPLC,
  indicating that the gold electrodes modified with copper nanoparticles could be
  used as salicylic acid sensors.
