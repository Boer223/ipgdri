abstract: This data article reports the establishment of the first pan-transcriptome
  resources for the Brassica A and C genomes. These were developed using existing
  coding DNA sequence (CDS) gene models from the now-published Brassica oleracea TO1000
  and Brassica napus Darmor-bzh genome sequence assemblies representing the chromosomes
  of these species, along with preliminary CDS models from an updated Brassica rapa
  Chiifu genome sequence assembly. The B. rapa genome sequence scaffolds required
  splitting and re-ordering to match the expected genome organisation based on a high
  density SNP linkage map, but the B. oleracea assembly was used unchanged. The resulting
  B. rapa (A genome) pseudomolecules contained 47,656 ordered CDS models and the B.
  oleracea (C genome) pseudomolecules contained 54,766 ordered CDS models. Interpolation
  of B. napus CDS models not already represented by orthologues resulted in 52,790
  and 63,308 ordered CDS models in the A and C pan-transcriptomes, an increase of
  13,676 overall. Comparison of the organisation of this resource with publicly available
  genome sequences for B. napus showed excellent consistency for the B. napus Darmor-bzh
  resource, but more breakdown of collinearity for the B. napus ZS11 resource. CDS
  datasets comprising the pan-transcriptomes are available with this article (B. rapa)
  or from public repositories (B. oleracea and B. napus).
