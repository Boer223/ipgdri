abstract: 'BACKGROUND: The methylotrophic yeast, Pichia pastoris, offers the possibility
  to generate a high amount of recombinant proteins in a fast and easy way to use
  expression system. Being a single-celled microorganism, P. pastoris is easy to manipulate
  and grows rapidly on inexpensive media at high cell densities. A simple and direct
  method for the selection of high-producing clones can dramatically enhance the whole
  production process along with significant decrease in production costs. RESULTS:
  A visual method for rapid selection of high-producing clones based on mannanase
  reporter system was developed. The study explained that it was possible to use mannanase
  activity as a measure of the expression level of the protein of interest. High-producing
  target protein clones were directly selected based on the size of hydrolysis holes
  in the selected plate. As an example, the target gene (9elp-hal18) was expressed
  and purified in Pichia pastoris using this technology. CONCLUSIONS: A novel methodology
  is proposed for obtaining the high-producing clones of proteins of interest, based
  on the mannanase reporter system. This system may be adapted to other microorganisms,
  such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae for the selection of clones.'
