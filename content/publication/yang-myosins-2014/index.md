abstract: The rapid reorganization and polarization of actin filaments (AFs) toward
  the pathogen penetration site is one of the earliest cellular responses, yet the
  regulatory mechanism of AF dynamics is poorly understood. Using live-cell imaging
  in Arabidopsis, we show that polarization coupled with AF bundling involves precise
  spatiotemporal control at the site of attempted penetration by the nonadapted barley
  powdery mildew fungus, Blumeria graminis f. sp. hordei (Bgh). We further show that
  the Bgh-triggered AF mobility and organelle aggregation are predominately driven
  by the myosin motor proteins. Inactivation of myosins by pharmacological inhibitors
  prevents bulk aggregation of organelles and blocks recruitment of lignin-like compounds
  to the penetration site and deposition of callose and defensive protein, PENETRATION
  1 (PEN1) into the apoplastic papillae, resulting in attenuation of penetration resistance.
  Using gene knockout analysis, we demonstrate that highly expressed myosins XI, especially
  myosin XI-K, are the primary contributors to cell wall-mediated penetration resistance.
  Moreover, the quadruple myosin knockout mutant xi-1 xi-2 xi-i xi-k displays impaired
  trafficking pathway responsible for the accumulation of PEN1 at the cell periphery.
  Strikingly, this mutant shows not only increased penetration rate but also enhanced
  overall disease susceptibility to both adapted and nonadapted fungal pathogens.
  Our findings establish myosins XI as key regulators of plant antifungal immunity.
