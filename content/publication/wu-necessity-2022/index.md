abstract: The planthopper resistance gene Bph6 encodes a protein that interacts with
  OsEXO70E1. EXO70 forms a family of paralogues in rice. We hypothesized that the
  EXO70-dependent trafficking pathway affects the excretion of resistance-related
  proteins, thus impacting plant resistance to planthoppers. Here, we further explored
  the function of EXO70 members in rice resistance against planthoppers. We used the
  yeast two-hybrid and co-immunoprecipitation assays to identify proteins that play
  roles in Bph6-mediated planthopper resistance. The functions of the identified proteins
  were characterized via gene transformation, plant resistance evaluation, insect
  performance, cell excretion observation and cell wall component analyses. We discovered
  that another EXO70 member, OsEXO70H3, interacted with BPH6 and functioned in cell
  excretion and in Bph6-mediated planthopper resistance. We further found that OsEXO70H3
  interacted with an S-adenosylmethionine synthetase-like protein (SAMSL) and increased
  the delivery of SAMSL outside the cells. The functional impairment of OsEXO70H3
  and SAMSL reduced the lignin content and the planthopper resistance level of rice
  plants. Our results suggest that OsEXO70H3 may recruit SAMSL and help its excretion
  to the apoplast where it may be involved in lignin deposition in cell walls, thus
  contributing to rice resistance to planthoppers.
