abstract: Necrotrophic pathogens such as Botrytis cinerea cause significant crop yield
  losses. Plant CCCH proteins play important roles in pathogen resistance responses.
  However, the CCCH-mediated defense mechanisms against necrotrophic pathogens are
  unclear. Here, we report that the Arabidopsis CCCH protein C3H14 positively regulates
  basal defense against B. cinerea mainly by WRKY33 signaling. Simultaneous mutation
  of C3H14 and its paralog C3H15 resulted in enhanced susceptibility to B. cinerea,
  while C3H14 or C3H15 overexpression lines exhibited reduced susceptibility. A large
  number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were present in the c3h14c3h15 double
  mutant and C3H14 overexpression plants compared with wild-type plants at 24â€‰hr post
  infection. These DEGs covered over one third of B. cinerea-responsive WRKY33 targets,
  including genes involved in jasmonic acid (JA)/ethylene (ET) signaling, and camalexin
  biosynthesis. Genetic analysis indicated that C3H14 mainly depended on WRKY33 to
  modulate defense against B. cinerea. Moreover, C3H14 activated the WRKY33-ORA59
  and -PAD3 cascades to correspondingly control JA/ET- and camalexin-mediated defense
  responses. However, C3H14 was essential for B. cinerea-induced production of 12-oxo-phytodienoic
  acid and it also directly mediated ORA59-dependent JA/ET signaling after infection.
  Therefore, C3H14 may act as a novel transcriptional regulator of the WRKY33-mediated
  defense pathway.
