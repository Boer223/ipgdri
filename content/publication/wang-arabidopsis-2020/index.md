abstract: Protein ubiquitination is critical for various biological processes in eukaryotes.
  A ubiquitin (Ub) chain can be linked through one of the seven lysine (K) residues
  or the N-terminus methionine of the Ub, and the Ub-conjugating enzymes called E2s
  play a critical role in determining the linkage specificity of Ub chains. Further,
  while K48-linked polyubiquitin chain is important for protein degradation, much
  less is known about the functions of other types of polyubiquitin chains in plants.
  We showed previously that UBC22 is unique in its ability to catalyze K11-dependent
  Ub dimer formation in vitro and ubc22 knockout mutants had defects in megasporogenesis.
  In this study, further analyses of the Arabidopsis ubc22 mutants revealed four subtypes
  of plants based on the phenotypic changes in vegetative growth. These four subtypes
  appeared consistently in the plants of three independent ubc22 mutants. Transcriptomic
  analysis showed that transcript levels of genes related to several pathways were
  altered differently in different subtypes of mutant plants. In one subtype, the
  mutant plants had increased expression of genes related to plant defenses and showed
  enhanced resistance to a necrotrophic plant pathogen. These results suggest multiple
  functions of UBC22 during plant development and stress response.
