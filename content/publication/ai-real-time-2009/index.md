abstract: Oxidative bursts from plants play significant roles in plant disease defense
  and signal transduction; however, it has not hitherto been investigated on individual
  living plant cells. In this article, we fabricated a novel sensitive electrochemical
  sensor based on electrochemical deposition of Pt nanoparticles on the surface of
  carbon fiber microdisk electrodes via a nanopores containing polymer matrix, Nafion.
  The numerous hydrophilic nanochannels in the Nafion clusters coated on the electrode
  surface served as the molecular template for the deposition and dispersion of Pt,
  which resulted in the uniform construction of small Pt nanoparticles. The novel
  sensor displayed a high sensitivity for detection of H(2)O(2) with a detection limit
  of 5.0 x 10(-9) M. With the use of this microelectrochemical sensor, the oxidative
  burst from individual living plant protoplasts have been real-time monitored for
  the first time. The results showed that oxidative burst from single protoplasts
  triggered by a pathogen analogue were characterized by quanta release with a large
  number of \"transient oxidative microburst\" events, and protoplasts from the transgenic
  plants biologically displayed better disease-resistance and showed a distinguished
  elevation and longer-lasting oxidative burst.
