abstract: Due to the rapid decline in oceanic fish stock, ω-3 fatty acid (C18:3) has
  attracted serious attention and, hence, the identification of genotypes with high
  ω-3 content has become the main objective of Brassica napus (rapeseed) breeding.
  A candidate genes association study permitted us to delineate a genomic region linked
  to ω-3 content, offering a detailed understanding of the complex genetic mechanism
  of fatty acid biosynthesis in B. napus. Herein, the candidate genes association
  study, conducted on 324 genetically diverse rapeseed accessions, detected 114 single
  nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with ω-3 fatty acid. Furthermore, these
  loci were functionally characterized in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. These associated
  loci were selected based on their contribution to a high C18:3 ratio, and the selected
  candidate loci were validated using allele-specific SNPs markers in an inbred population
  through polymerase chain reaction (PCR). These findings may contribute to improving
  the fatty acid composition by marker-based breeding and will facilitate the development
  of rapeseed varieties with high ω-3 content.
