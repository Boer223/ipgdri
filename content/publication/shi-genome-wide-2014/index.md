abstract: 'Although much research has been conducted, the pattern of microsatellite
  distribution has remained ambiguous, and the development/utilization of microsatellite
  markers has still been limited/inefficient in Brassica, due to the lack of genome
  sequences. In view of this, we conducted genome-wide microsatellite characterization
  and marker development in three recently sequenced Brassica crops: Brassica rapa,
  Brassica oleracea and Brassica napus. The analysed microsatellite characteristics
  of these Brassica species were highly similar or almost identical, which suggests
  that the pattern of microsatellite distribution is likely conservative in Brassica.
  The genomic distribution of microsatellites was highly non-uniform and positively
  or negatively correlated with genes or transposable elements, respectively. Of the
  total of 115 869, 185 662 and 356 522 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers developed
  with high frequencies (408.2, 343.8 and 356.2 per Mb or one every 2.45, 2.91 and
  2.81 kb, respectively), most represented new SSR markers, the majority had determined
  physical positions, and a large number were genic or putative single-locus SSR markers.
  We also constructed a comprehensive database for the newly developed SSR markers,
  which was integrated with public Brassica SSR markers and annotated genome components.
  The genome-wide SSR markers developed in this study provide a useful tool to extend
  the annotated genome resources of sequenced Brassica species to genetic study/breeding
  in different Brassica species.'
