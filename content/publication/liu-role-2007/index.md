abstract: We have been using a mutational approach to determine how plant-beneficial
  bacteria such as Enterobacter cloacae 501R3 obtain carbon and energy for colonization
  of subterranean portions of cucumber and other plants. Reduced carbon detected in
  cucumber root exudate consisted of 73.3 % amino acids, 22.2 % organic acids and
  4.4 % carbohydrate. Ent. cloacae M2, a mini-Tn5 Km transposon mutant of strain 501R3,
  was severely reduced in in vitro growth relative to strain 501R3 on the mixture
  of amino acids and organic acids detected in cucumber root exudate when these compounds
  were supplied as the sole source of carbon and energy, but was similar in growth
  on the mixture of carbohydrates detected in this exudate. Molecular and biochemical
  characterization of Ent. cloacae M2 indicated that the transposon was inserted in
  sdhA, which encodes a subunit of succinate dehydrogenase. Ent. cloacae A-11, a mutant
  of strain 501R3 with a mini-Tn5 Km insertion in pfkA, was severely reduced in in
  vitro growth relative to strain 501R3 on the mixture of carbohydrates detected in
  cucumber root exudate, but similar in growth on the mixture of amino acids and organic
  acids. When strains A-11 and M2 were coapplied with strain 501R3 to cucumber seeds
  above carrying capacity in competitive root colonization assays, populations of
  strains A-11 and M2 were roughly one order of magnitude lower than those of strain
  501R3 in cucumber rhizosphere, while populations of strains A-11 and M2 were similar
  to one other when coapplied to cucumber seeds. When Ent. cloacae strains were coapplied
  to cucumber seeds below carrying capacity, populations of A-11 and M2 were roughly
  two to three orders of magnitude lower than those of 501R3 in cucumber rhizosphere,
  and populations of A-11 were significantly lower than those of M2 when these two
  strains were coapplied to cucumber seed. The experiments reported here indicate
  an important role for pfkA and sdhA and the catabolism of carbohydrates, and of
  amino acids and organic acids, respectively, in the colonization of cucumber roots
  by Ent. cloacae. The results reported here also indicate that catabolism of carbohydrates
  by this bacterium is more important than catabolism of amino acids and organic acids
  at lower population densities, despite the much higher relative quantities of amino
  acids and organic acids detected in cucumber root exudate.
