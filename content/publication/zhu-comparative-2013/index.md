abstract: "The peanut plant produces flowers aerially, while develops the fruits and\
  \ seeds underground. Pod swelling is a vital process of peanut pod and seed development\
  \ only occurring after the gynophore carrying the ovule into the soil. The failure\
  \ of gynophore penetration into the soil leads to suppression of pod swelling initiation.\
  \ However, the molecular mechanism underlying the process remains unknown. A comparative\
  \ proteome analysis between developing aerial and subterranean pods at various developmental\
  \ stages was performed using 2-DE approach. 47 significantly differentially expressed\
  \ spots were selected to further identification by MALDI-TOF-TOF MS. They were corresponded\
  \ to 31 distinct proteins, suggesting that many identified spots were modified in\
  \ post-translation. Functional annotation revealed their involvement in twelve important\
  \ biological processes, such as photosynthesis, oxidative stress response, lignin\
  \ synthesis, fatty acid biosynthesis, glycolysis, protein catabolic process, cellular\
  \ metabolic process, regulation process, etc. Furthermore, 10 identified proteins\
  \ were validated by real-time RT-PCR analysis. Several photosynthesis and oxidative\
  \ stress proteins displayed elevated expression levels in aerial pods. Otherwise,\
  \ enzymes in lignin synthesis and ubiquitin proteasome system were down-accumulation\
  \ in subterranean pods. These enzymes might function as potential candidate proteins\
  \ and play critical roles to regulate pods swelling and development. BIOLOGICAL\
  \ SIGNIFICANCE: Pod swelling plays a crucial role in peanut fruit and seed development.\
  \ However, a large number of aerial pods can't form normal pods due to suppression\
  \ of swelling initiation by the failure of penetration into the soil, thereby causing\
  \ to seed yield loss. Limited knowledge is available underlying molecular mechanism\
  \ regulating initiation of swelling in peg tips and pod development. The results\
  \ generated in this study may provide evidence for some functional proteins as potential\
  \ candidates to pod swelling and new molecular insights to improve our understanding\
  \ of pod development under light and darkness conditions, which may contribute valuable\
  \ information to high yield breeding in future."
