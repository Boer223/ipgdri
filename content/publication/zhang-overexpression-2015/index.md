abstract: Sclerotinia sclerotiorum and Botrytis cinerea are notorious plant pathogenic
  fungi with an extensive host range including Brassica crops. Glucosinolates (GSLs)
  are an important group of secondary metabolites characteristic of the Brassicales
  order, whose degradation products are proving to be increasingly important in plant
  protection. Enhancing the defense effect of GSL and their associated degradation
  products is an attractive strategy to strengthen the resistance of plants by transgenic
  approaches. We generated the lines of Brassica napus with three biosynthesis genes
  involved in GSL metabolic pathway (BnMAM1, BnCYP83A1 and BnUGT74B1), respectively.
  We then measured the foliar GSLs of each transgenic lines and inoculated them with
  S. sclerotiorum and B. cinerea. Compared with the wild type control, over-expressing
  BnUGT74B1 in B. napus increased the aliphatic and indolic GSL levels by 1.7 and
  1.5 folds in leaves respectively; while over-expressing BnMAM1 or BnCYP83A1 resulted
  in an approximate 1.5-fold higher only in the aliphatic GSL level in leaves. The
  results of plant inoculation demonstrated that BnUGT74B1-overexpressing lines showed
  less severe disease symptoms and tissue damage compared with the wild type control,
  but BnMAM1 or BnCYP83A1-overexpressing lines showed no significant difference in
  comparison to the controls. These results suggest that the resistance to S. sclerotiorum
  and B. cinerea in B. napus could be enhanced through tailoring the GSL profiles
  by transgenic approaches or molecular breeding, which provides useful information
  to assist plant breeders to design improved breeding strategies.
