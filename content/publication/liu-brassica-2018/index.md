abstract: This book describes how the genome sequence contributes to our understanding
  of allopolyploidisation and the genome evolution, genetic diversity, complex trait
  regulation and knowledge-based breeding of this important crop. Numerous examples
  demonstrate how widespread homoeologous genome rearrangements and exchanges have
  moulded structural genome diversity following a severe polyploidy bottleneck. The
  allopolyploid crop species Brassica napus has the most highly duplicated plant genome
  to be assembled to date, with the largest number of annotated genes.  Examples are
  provided for use of the genome sequence to identify and capture diversity for important
  agronomic traits, including seed quality and disease resistance. The increased potential
  for detailed ge ne discovery using high-density genetic mapping, quantitative genetics
  and transcriptomic analyses is described in the context of genome availability and
  illustrated with recent examples. Intimate knowledge of the highly-duplicated gene
  space, on the one hand, and the repeat landscape on the other, particularly in comparison
  to the two diploid progenitor genomes, provide a fundamental basis for new insights
  into the regulatory mechanisms that are coupled with selection for polyploid success
  and crop evolution.
