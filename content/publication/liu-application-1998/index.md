abstract: Factors affecting resistance of rape cultivars to oxalic acid （OA） and the
  efficiency of using OA to screen resistance rape to Sclerotinia sclerotiorum was
  investigated. The results showed that toxic index increased along with temperature
  and OA concentration , respectively. It decreased with the increase of relative
  humidity and seedling age, respectively. The change of toxic index with treatment
  time followed Logistic-growth curve. The optimal conditions for the test of cultivar
  resistance using OA were studied. Eight cultivars （lines） were selected by soaking
  detached leaves. The disease index of the progeny populations of the selected single
  plant decreased by 65. 6% compared to non-selected natural pollinated population.
  The disease index of the natural pollinated populations of the following generation
  reduced 33. 5%. The diseased leaf area of root treated seedlings reduced 1.7% -68%
  compared to that of the original population.
