 abstract = {Sclerotinia stem rot caused by Sclerotiniasclerotiorum is an important fungi disease in oil crops especially in Brassica napus. For plant breeding, screening of Sclerotinia resistance genes is important. Most F-box genes participated in plant defense response, and LRR regarded as the important domain of resistant genes. Thereby, F-box genes were investigated in this study. Genome-wide identification of F-box-LRR gene in B. napus was conducted by bioinformatics method. Based on published data of tissue expression in Zhongshuang 11 and transcriptome data of inoculation fungi on leaves of susceptible Westar and resistant Zhongyou 821, corresponding Bn-F-box-LRR genes were identified and then verified by qRT-PCR. 161 BnF-box-LRR genes were found and classified into 4 subgroups （FBXLRR1 to FBXLRR4）. The fourth subgroup, FBXLRR4, was significantly different from the other three in the conserved protein distribution and gene structure. It was clustered into the same clade with the homologous genes which involved in plant stress resistance in Arabidopsis thaliana. Therefore, it is speculated that this subgroup might be mainly involved in plant stress response. Based on transcriptome data, it was found that most FBXLRR4 genes were highly expressed in root and leaves, and showed significant expression alternation after S.sclerotiorum induction, indicating these genes potentially in Sclerotinia disease resistant.},
