abstract: Sclerotinia stem rot caused by Sclerotiniasclerotiorum is an important fungi
  disease in oil crops especially in Brassica napus. For plant breeding, screening
  of Sclerotinia resistance genes is important. Most F-box genes participated in plant
  defense response, and LRR regarded as the important domain of resistant genes. Thereby,
  F-box genes were investigated in this study. Genome-wide identification of F-box-LRR
  gene in B. napus was conducted by bioinformatics method. Based on published data
  of tissue expression in Zhongshuang 11 and transcriptome data of inoculation fungi
  on leaves of susceptible Westar and resistant Zhongyou 821, corresponding Bn-F-box-LRR
  genes were identified and then verified by qRT-PCR. 161 BnF-box-LRR genes were found
  and classified into 4 subgroups （FBXLRR1 to FBXLRR4）. The fourth subgroup, FBXLRR4,
  was significantly different from the other three in the conserved protein distribution
  and gene structure. It was clustered into the same clade with the homologous genes
  which involved in plant stress resistance in Arabidopsis thaliana. Therefore, it
  is speculated that this subgroup might be mainly involved in plant stress response.
  Based on transcriptome data, it was found that most FBXLRR4 genes were highly expressed
  in root and leaves, and showed significant expression alternation after S.sclerotiorum
  induction, indicating these genes potentially in Sclerotinia disease resistant.
