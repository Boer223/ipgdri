abstract: Root colonization of rapeseed by Pseudomonas alcaligenes A9（LacZ） in rhizosphere
  microcosms was investigated with aid of marker gene lacZ. Rape seeds were pelletized
  with A9（LacZ）, an effective bacterial strain in promotion rape seedling growth.
  Results indicated that A9（LacZ） populations decreased with increasing distance down
  rapeseed roots and with time after sowing. Populations of A9（LacZ） were not detectable
  on roots more than 8cm from the hypocotyl base. The population density of A9（LacZ）
  on roots reached the maximum of 7.6×10 5/g 3 days after sowing, and declined rapidly
  to lower populations （1.1×10 2/g） in rhizosphere microcosms 30 days after sowing.
