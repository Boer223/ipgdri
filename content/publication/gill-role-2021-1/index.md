abstract: Transposable elements (TEs) represent a major and variable portion of plant
  genomes, and recent progress in genetics and genomics has highlighted the importance
  of different TE species as a useful genetic tool in crop breeding. TEs can cause
  changes in the pattern of gene expression, and regulate gene function by various
  means such as cis- up- or down-regulation of nearby genes through insertion at promoter,
  intron, exon and down-stream regions, and trans-production of short interfering
  RNAs (siRNAs) via two RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) pathways. siRNAs generated
  through different RdDM pathways differ in length and have variable effects on TEs.
  For instance, noncoding siRNAs of 20–60 nt produced by RNA polymerase IV (dicer-independent)
  and 21/22 nt by Pol II (dicer-dependent) have only minor effects on TEs compared
  with 24 nt siRNAs produced by Pol IV (dicer-dependent pathways). Following whole-genome
  duplication (WGD) events after polyploidization in allopolyploids, TEs from either
  parent are able to induce siRNAs to regulate the complex polyploid genome. Those
  designated as ‘controllers’ usually reside in the dominant parent and affect the
  TEs of the recessive parent. Subgenome cross-talk thus appears to contribute to
  epigenetic regulation as well as reshuffling or restructuring of subgenomes and
  creation of novel patterns of genes expression/and variation in local or global
  copy number. In this review, we focus on recent progress in unraveling the role
  of TEs in gene expression regulation via TE-derived siRNAs in the context of polyploid
  plant evolution and environmental stress, and explore how ancient WGD and recent
  polyploidy affected the evolution of TE-induced epigenetic mechanisms.
