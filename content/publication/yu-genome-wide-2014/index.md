abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Plant disease resistance (R) genes with the nucleotide binding
  site (NBS) play an important role in offering resistance to pathogens. The availability
  of complete genome sequences of Brassica oleracea and Brassica rapa provides an
  important opportunity for researchers to identify and characterize NBS-encoding
  R genes in Brassica species and to compare with analogues in Arabidopsis thaliana
  based on a comparative genomics approach. However, little is known about the evolutionary
  fate of NBS-encoding genes in the Brassica lineage after split from A. thaliana.
  RESULTS: Here we present genome-wide analysis of NBS-encoding genes in B. oleracea,
  B. rapa and A. thaliana. Through the employment of HMM search and manual curation,
  we identified 157, 206 and 167 NBS-encoding genes in B. oleracea, B. rapa and A.
  thaliana genomes, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis among 3 species classified
  NBS-encoding genes into 6 subgroups. Tandem duplication and whole genome triplication
  (WGT) analyses revealed that after WGT of the Brassica ancestor, NBS-encoding homologous
  gene pairs on triplicated regions in Brassica ancestor were deleted or lost quickly,
  but NBS-encoding genes in Brassica species experienced species-specific gene amplification
  by tandem duplication after divergence of B. rapa and B. oleracea. Expression profiling
  of NBS-encoding orthologous gene pairs indicated the differential expression pattern
  of retained orthologous gene copies in B. oleracea and B. rapa. Furthermore, evolutionary
  analysis of CNL type NBS-encoding orthologous gene pairs among 3 species suggested
  that orthologous genes in B. rapa species have undergone stronger negative selection
  than those in B .oleracea species. But for TNL type, there are no significant differences
  in the orthologous gene pairs between the two species. CONCLUSION: This study is
  first identification and characterization of NBS-encoding genes in B. rapa and B.
  oleracea based on whole genome sequences. Through tandem duplication and whole genome
  triplication analysis in B. oleracea, B. rapa and A. thaliana genomes, our study
  provides insight into the evolutionary history of NBS-encoding genes after divergence
  of A. thaliana and the Brassica lineage. These results together with expression
  pattern analysis of NBS-encoding orthologous genes provide useful resource for functional
  characterization of these genes and genetic improvement of relevant crops.'
