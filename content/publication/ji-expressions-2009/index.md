abstract: Expressions of three defense genes（PR-1,GLU and CHI） of salicylic acid（SA）-dependent
  signaling pathway were measured by RT-PCR in transgenic oilseed rape（Brassica napus）
  lines and wild plants.The results showed that the three genes were all up-regulated
  expressed in transgenic lines,which indicated that the mechanism of enhanced resistance
  to Sclerotinia sclerotiorum of transgenic lines was related to the induction of
  SA-dependent signaling pathway.
