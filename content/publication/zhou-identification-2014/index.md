abstract: To understand the evolution of vacuole iron transporter (VIT) genes in Brassica，9，13，12
  and 14 VIT candidate genes were identified in Arabidopsis thaliana，Brassica rapa，B．
  oleracea and B． napus respectively， based on genome － wide sequences of the 4 species，as
  well as the VIT conserved domain and HMMER software． Phylogenetic analysis showed
  that the VIT gene family was divided into 3 classes． In the promoter region，LTRE，
  ABRE，MYC，MYB and W － box cis elements were plentiful． Protein feature analysis indicated
  that the VIT do- main contained more conservative hydrophobic amino acid residues．
  Gene expression profile showed that most of the VIT genes basically expressed in
  selected tissue in different levels． Syntenic related homologous genes presented
  both similar and diverse expression patterns，while the expression pattern of tandem
  duplicated genes were identi- cal．
