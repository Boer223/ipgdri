abstract: Oxidative burst is the rapid and transient production of large amounts of
  reactive oxygen species, including superoxide anion, hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)),
  and hydroxyl radical. A rapid and simple technique was employed for in vivo detection
  of oxidative burst in oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.) leaves, using a modified
  electrode. Platinum (Pt) micro-particles were dispersed on a Pt electrode, coated
  with a poly (o-phenylenediamine) film. This exhibited high sensitivity, selectivity
  and stability in H(2)O(2) detection. Amperometry was used to obtain satisfactory
  linear relationships between reductive current intensities and H(2)O(2) concentrations
  at -0.1 V potential in different electrolytes. This electrode was used in vivo to
  detect oxidative burst in oilseed rape following fungal infection. Oxidative bursts
  induced by infection of the fungal pathogen Sclerotinia sclerotiorum (Lib.) de Bary
  exhibited notably different mechanisms between a susceptible and a resistant glucose
  oxidase-transgenic genotype.
