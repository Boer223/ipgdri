abstract: Iron toxicity is a nutrient disorder that severely affects crop development
  and yield in some soil conditions. Vacuolar detoxification of metal stress is an
  important strategy for plants to survive and adapt to this adverse environment.
  Vacuolar iron transporter (VIT) members are involved in this process and play essential
  roles in iron storage and transport. In this study, we identified a rapeseed VIT
  gene BnMEB2 (BnaC07g30170D) homologs to Arabidopsis MEB2 (At5g24290). Transient
  expression analysis revealed that BnMEB2 was localized to the vacuolar membrane.
  Q-PCR detection showed a high expression of BnMEB2 in mature (60-day-old) leaves
  and could be obviously induced by exogenous iron stress in both roots and leaves.
  Over-expressed BnMEB2 in both Arabidopsis wild type and meb2 mutant seedlings resulted
  in greatly improved iron tolerability with no significant changes in the expression
  level of other VIT genes. The mutant meb2 grew slowly and its root hair elongation
  was inhibited under high iron concentration condition while BnMEB2 over-expressed
  transgenic plants of the mutant restored the phenotypes with apparently higher iron
  storage in roots and dramatically increased iron content in the whole plant. Taken
  together, these results suggested that BnMEB2 was a VIT gene in rapeseed which was
  necessary for safe storage and vacuole detoxification function of excess iron to
  enhance the tolerance of iron toxicity. This research sheds light on a potentially
  new strategy for attenuating hazardous metal stress from environment and improving
  iron biofortification in Brassicaceae crops.
