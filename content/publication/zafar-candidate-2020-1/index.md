abstract: Brassica napus (rapeseed) serves as a main source of edible oil, and the
  oil's quality is mainly determined by the relative proportions of fatty acids. A
  high oleic acid concentration in B. napus oil increases its shelf life and oxidative
  stability. Therefore, attaining a high oleic acid concentration is necessary to
  enhance the nutritional quality of rapeseed oil. Here, an association study of candidate
  genes was conducted using a population of 324 genetically diverse rapeseed accessions,
  and several loci related to oleic acid content were identified. Furthermore, these
  loci were functionally characterized in Saccharomyces cerevisiae to assess their
  functions, and the promising candidate loci were validated using single nucleotide
  polymorphic markers in an independent inbred population. The results increased our
  understanding of fatty acid metabolism in B. napus. Moreover, these findings may
  assist in marker-based breeding efforts to improve the fatty acid composition and
  quality of B. napus oil.
