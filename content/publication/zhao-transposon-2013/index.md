abstract: Transposons or transposable elements (TEs) are ubiquitous and most abundant
  DNA components in higher  eukaryotes. Recent sequencing of the Brassica rapa and
  B. oleracea genomes revealed that the amplification of TEs is one of the main factors
  inducing the difference in genome size. However, the expressions of TEs and the
  TE effects on gene regulation and functions of these two Brassica diploid species
  were unclear. Here, we analyzed the RNA sequencing data of leaves, roots, and stems
  from B. rapa and B. oleracea. Our data showed that overall TEs in either genome
  expressed at very low levels, and the expression levels of different TE categories
  and families varied among different organs. Moreover, even for the same TE category
  or family, the expression activities were distinct between the two Brassica diploids.
  Forty-one and nine LTR retrotransposons with the transcripts that read into their
  adjacent sequences have the distances shorter than 2 kb and 100 bp compared to the
  downstream genes. These LTR retrotransposon readout transcriptions may produce sense
  or antisense transcripts of nearby genes, with the effects on activating or silencing
  corresponding genes. Meanwhile, intact LTRs were detected at stronger readout activities
  than solo LTRs. Of the TEs inserted into genes, the frequencies were ob- served
  at a higher level in B. rapa than in B. oleracea. In addition, DNA transposons were
  prone to insert or retain in the intronic regions of genes in either Brassica genomes.
  These results revealed that the TEs may have potential effects on regulating protein
  coding genes.
