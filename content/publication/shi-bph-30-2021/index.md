abstract: Phloem-feeding insects cause massive losses in agriculture and horticulture.
  Host plantÂ resistance to phloem-feeding insects is often mediated by changes in
  phloem composition, which deter insect settling and feeding and decrease viability.
  Here, we report that rice plant resistance to the phloem-feeding brown planthopper
  (BPH) is associated with fortification of the sclerenchyma tissue, which is located
  just beneath the epidermis and a cell layer or two away from the vascular bundle
  in the rice leaf sheath. We found that BPHs prefer to feed on the smooth and soft
  region on the surface of rice leaf sheaths called the long-cell block. We identified
  Bph30 as a rice BPH resistance gene that prevents BPH stylets from reaching the
  phloem due to the fortified sclerenchyma. Bph30 is strongly expressed in sclerenchyma
  cells and enhances cellulose and hemicellulose synthesis, making the cell walls
  stiffer and sclerenchyma thicker. The structurally fortified sclerenchyma is a formidable
  barrier preventing BPH stylets from penetrating the leaf sheath tissues and arriving
  at the phloem to feed. Bph30 belongs to a novel gene family, encoding a protein
  with two leucine-rich domains. Another member of the family, Bph40, also conferred
  resistance to BPH. Collectively, the fortified sclerenchyma-mediated resistance
  mechanism revealed in this study expands our understanding of plant-insect interactions
  and opens a new path for controlling planthoppers in rice.
