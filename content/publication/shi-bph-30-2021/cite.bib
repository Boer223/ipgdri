 abstract = {Phloem-feeding insects cause massive losses in agriculture and horticulture. Host plant resistance to phloem-feeding insects is often mediated by changes in phloem composition, which deter insect settling and feeding and decrease viability. Here, we report that rice plant resistance to the phloem-feeding brown planthopper (BPH) is associated with fortification of the sclerenchyma tissue, which is located just beneath the epidermis and a cell layer or two away from the vascular bundle in the rice leaf sheath. We found that BPHs prefer to feed on the smooth and soft region on the surface of rice leaf sheaths called the long-cell block. We identified Bph30 as a rice BPH resistance gene that prevents BPH stylets from reaching the phloem due to the fortified sclerenchyma. Bph30 is strongly expressed in sclerenchyma cells and enhances cellulose and hemicellulose synthesis, making the cell walls stiffer and sclerenchyma thicker. The structurally fortified sclerenchyma is a formidable barrier preventing BPH stylets from penetrating the leaf sheath tissues and arriving at the phloem to feed. Bph30 belongs to a novel gene family, encoding a protein with two leucine-rich domains. Another member of the family, Bph40, also conferred resistance to BPH. Collectively, the fortified sclerenchyma-mediated resistance mechanism revealed in this study expands our understanding of plant-insect interactions and opens a new path for controlling planthoppers in rice.},
