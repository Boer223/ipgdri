abstract: Studying the genetic basis of variation in plant metabolism has been greatly
  facilitated by genomic and metabolic profiling advances. In this study, we use metabolomics
  and growth measurements to map QTL in rice, a major staple crop. Previous rice metabolism
  studies have largely focused on identifying genes controlling major effect loci.
  To complement these studies, we conducted a replicated metabolomics analysis on
  a japonica (Lemont) by indica (Teqing) rice recombinant inbred line population and
  focused on the genetic variation for primary metabolism. Using independent replicated
  studies, we show that in contrast to other rice studies, the heritability of primary
  metabolism is similar to Arabidopsis. The vast majority of metabolic QTLs had small
  to moderate effects with significant polygenic epistasis. Two metabolomics QTL hotspots
  had opposing effects on carbon and nitrogen rich metabolites suggesting that they
  may influence carbon and nitrogen partitioning, with one locus co-localizing with
  SUSIBA2 (WRKY78). Comparing QTLs for metabolomic and a variety of growth related
  traits identified few overlaps. Interestingly, the rice population displayed fewer
  loci controlling stochastic variation for metabolism than was found in Arabidopsis.
  Thus, it is possible that domestication has differentially impacted stochastic metabolite
  variation more than average metabolite variation.
