abstract: The resistance of twenty-four progeny lines,derived from the hybrid between
  Brassica napus and Sinapis alba,to Sclerotinia sclerotiorum was tested through inoculation
  of stem and detached leaves with mycelia of the pathogen.No significant difference
  was found between eleven progeny lines and resistant variety Zhongshuang No.9,other
  four lines showed significantly stronger resistance.This study demonstrated the
  disease resistance of intergeneric hybrid progenies can be increased significantly,it
  can play an important role in disease resistance breeding.
