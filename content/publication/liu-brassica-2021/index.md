abstract: This book presents comprehensive information on genetics, genomics and breeding
  in Brassica oleracea, an agriculturally important species that includes popular
  vegetable crops such as cabbage, cauliflower, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, kale,
  collard greens, savoy, kohlrabi, and gai lan.  The content spans whole genome sequencing,
  assembly and gene annotation for this global vegetable species, along with molecular
  mapping and cloning of genes, physical genome mapping and analyses of the structure
  and composition of centromeres in the B. oleracea genome. The book also elaborates
  on asymmetrical genome evolution and transposable elements in the B. oleracea describes
  gene family differentiation in comparison to other Brassica species and structural
  and functional genomic resources and data bases developed for B. oleracea. Useful
  discussions on the impact of genome sequencing on genetic improvement in the species
  are also included.
