abstract: To understand the anti- virus function of SGS3 gene in Brassica napus,gene
  Bn SGS3 was cloned from rapeseed cultivar Zhongshuang 6 by 5’- RACE and nested PCR.
  Sequence analysis showed that Bn SGS3 includes 2 638 bp,4 introns and a 1 824 bp
  complete ORF. DNAMAN comparison result showed that the similarities between Bn SGS3
  and other SGS3 genes were 58. 9% to 97. 5%. Over- expressing vector Bn SGS3- Ov
  and interfering vector Bn SGS3- Si were constructed and transformed into Arabidopsis
  thaliana Columbia ecotype by floral-dip method. 30 transgenic plants of each vector
  were obtained verified by herbicide spray and PCR identification.After cucumber
  mosaic virus（ CMV） inoculation,Bn SGS3- Ov transgenic Arabidopsis plants showed
  moderate resistance to CMV with slighter symptoms than those from Bn SGS3- Si transgenic
  plants. These Bn SGS3- Ov plants could grow and flower normally. But Bn SGS3- Si
  plants were seriously infected by CMV with abnormal plants and no flower. Youcai
  mosaic virus（ Yo MV） inoculation result showed that both transgenic and wild type
  plants were susceptive. It suggested that Bn SGS3 gene conferred moderate resistance
  to CMV,but no obvious resistance to YoMV.
