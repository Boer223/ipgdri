abstract: A diallel mating design following Griffing’s method Ⅳ with six parents was
  employed for genetic analysis of resistance to Sclerotinia sclerotiorum and its
  toxin oxalic acid（OA）.These parents with a wide range of levels of resistance were
  bred during last fifteen years.Resistance was identified by methods of green- house
  disease nursery and seedlings fed oxalate through roots,which identified resistance
  to S.sclerotiorum and OA,respectively.The program used for genetic analysis was
  based on a model of the additive-dominance proposed by Zhu and Weir.Significant（Ptextless0.01）additive
  and dominant variances were detected for disease index from both methods.The additive
  variance of resistance to S.sclerotiorum identified in the nursery was larger than
  the dominant variance.Contrarily,the additive variance of resistance to toxin was
  lower than the dominant variance.Heritability was estimated from disease index.Significant（Ptextless0.01）narrow
  and broad heritabilities of resistance to the fungus infection were 0.403 and 0.750,respectively,and
  significant（Ptextless 0.05）narrow and broad heritabilities of resistance to OA were
  0.236 and 0.576,respectively.The results suggested that selection for resistance
  would generally be effective.Genetic effects in resistant and susceptible parents
  were different.Additive effects were generally negative （toward reducing disease）
  in resistant parents and positive in susceptible parents,suggesting resistant parents
  like 783-3 should be used for resistance breed- ing.Dominant effects in crosses
  between resistant and susceptible parents were either negative or positive de- pending
  on specific crosses and thus resistance of such crosses should be evaluated by experiments
  rather than prediction based on parents.
