abstract: Optimizing the profile and quantity of fatty acids in rapeseed (Brassica
  napus L.) is critical for maximizing the value of edible oil and biodiesel. However,
  selection of these complex seed quality traits is difficult before haplotypes controlling
  their contents are identified. To efficiently identify genetic loci influencing
  these traits and underlying candidate genes and networks, we performed a genome-wide
  association study (GWAS) of eight seed quality traits (oil and protein content,
  palmitic, stearic, oleic, linoleic, eicosenoic and erucic acids content). The GWAS
  population comprised 370 diverse accessions, which were phenotyped in five environments
  and genotyped using 60K SNP arrays. The results indicated that oil and protein contents
  generally showed negative correlations, while fatty acid contents showed positive
  or negative correlations, with palmitic and erucic acid contents directly affecting
  oil content. Seven SNPs on five chromosomes were associated with both seed oil and
  protein content, and five genes orthologous to genes in Arabidopsis thaliana were
  predicted as candidates. From resequencing data, besides known haplotypes in BnaA.FAE1.a
  and BnaC.FAE1.a, three accessions harboring a new haplotype conferring moderate
  erucic acid content were identified. Interestingly, in a haplotype block, one haplotype
  was associated with high palmitic acid content and low oil content, while the others
  showed the reverse effects. This finding was consistent with a negative correlation
  between palmitic acid and oil contents, suggesting historical selection for high
  oil content. The identification by this study of genetic variation and complex correlations
  of eight seed quality traits may be beneficial for crop selection strategies.
