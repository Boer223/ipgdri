abstract: Verticillium longisporum, a soil-borne pathogenic fungus, causes vascular
  disease in oilseed rape (Brassica napus). We proposed that plant microRNAs (miRNAs)
  are involved in the plant-V. longisporum interaction. To identify oilseed rape miRNAs,
  we deep-sequenced two small RNA libraries made from V. longisporum infected/noninfected
  roots and employed Brassica rapa and Brassica oleracea genomes as references for
  miRNA prediction and characterization. We identified 893 B. napus miRNAs representing
  360 conserved and 533 novel miRNAs, and mapped 429 and 464 miRNAs to the AA and
  CC genomes, respectively. Microsynteny analysis with the conserved miRNAs and their
  flanking protein coding sequences revealed 137 AA-CC genome syntenic miRNA pairs
  and 61 AA and 42 CC genome-unique miRNAs. Sixty-two miRNAs were responsive to the
  V. longisporum infection. We present data for specific interactions and simultaneously
  reciprocal changes in the expression levels of the miRNAs and their targets in the
  infected roots. We demonstrate that miRNAs are involved in the plant-fungus interaction
  and that miRNA168-Argonaute 1 (AGO1) expression modulation might act as a key regulatory
  module in a compatible plant-V. longisporum interaction. Our results suggest that
  V. longisporum may have evolved a virulence mechanism by interference with plant
  miRNAs to reprogram plant gene expression and achieve infection.
