abstract: Polyploidy complicates genomics-based breeding of many crops, including
  wheat, potato, cotton, oat and sugarcane. To address this challenge, we sequenced
  leaf transcriptomes across a mapping population of the polyploid crop oilseed rape
  (Brassica napus) and representative ancestors of the parents of the population.
  Analysis of sequence variation and transcript abundance enabled us to construct
  twin single nucleotide polymorphism linkage maps of B. napus, comprising 23,037
  markers. We used these to align the B. napus genome with that of a related species,
  Arabidopsis thaliana, and to genome sequence assemblies of its progenitor species,
  Brassica rapa and Brassica oleracea. We also developed methods to detect genome
  rearrangements and track inheritance of genomic segments, including the outcome
  of an interspecific cross. By revealing the genetic consequences of breeding, cost-effective,
  high-resolution dissection of crop genomes by transcriptome sequencing will increase
  the efficiency of predictive breeding even in the absence of a complete genome sequence.
