abstract: For global demand of high yield breeding, complex genetic regulation on
  plant architecture was fo- cused by genome-wide association study (GWAS) and principal
  component analysis (PCA), based on 4 typical traits related to plant architecture
  (PA) of 373 B. napus (L.) accessions. The 4 traits included plant height, branch
  height, branch number and main inflorescence length in 3 environments (Wuhan 2014-2015,
  Wuhan 2015-2016, and Yangzhou 2015-2016). Results showed that PCA could reasonably
  explain the phenotypes related to PA. PCA- GWAS and normal GWAS could verify and
  complement each other and provide the most information on traits that determine
  rapeseed architecture. Further, 19 PA related candidate genes were obtained from
  chromosomes A01, A10 and C06. Two genes on chromosome C06 were related to the new
  loci identified by PC1-GWAS. This method and results provide new ideas and strategies
  for the analysis of the formation mechanism of complex traits such as PA.
