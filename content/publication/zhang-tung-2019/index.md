abstract: Tung tree (Vernicia fordii) is an economically important woody oil plant
  that produces tung oil rich in eleostearic acid. Here, we report a high-quality
  chromosome-scale genome sequence of tung tree. The genome sequence was assembled
  by combining Illumina short reads, Pacific Biosciences single-molecule real-time
  long reads, and Hi-C sequencing data. The size of tung tree genome is 1.12â€¯Gb, with
  28,422 predicted genes and over 73% repeat sequences. The V. fordii underwent an
  ancient genome triplication event shared by core eudicots but no further whole-genome
  duplication in the subsequent ca. 34.55 million years of evolutionary history of
  the tung tree lineage. Insertion time analysis revealed that repeat-driven genome
  expansion might have arisen as a result of long-standing long terminal repeat retrotransposon
  bursts and lack of efficient DNA deletion mechanisms. The genome harbors 88 resistance
  genes encoding nucleotide-binding sites; 17 of these genes may be involved in early-infection
  stage of Fusarium wilt resistance. Further, 651 oil-related genes were identified,
  88 of which are predicted to be directly involved in tung oil biosynthesis. Relatively
  few phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase genes, and synergistic effects between transcription
  factors and oil biosynthesis-related genes might contribute to the high oil content
  of tung seed. The tung tree genome constitutes a valuable resource for understanding
  genome evolution, as well as for molecular breeding and genetic improvements for
  oil production.
