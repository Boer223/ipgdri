abstract: 'Canola exhibits an extensive genetic variation for resistance to blackleg
  disease, caused by the fungal pathogen Leptosphaeria maculans. Despite the identification
  of several Avr effectors and R (race-specific) genes, specific interactions between
  Avr-R genes are not yet fully understood in the Brassica napus-L. maculans pathosystem.
  In this study, we investigated the genetic basis of resistance in an F2 : 3 population
  derived from Australian canola varieties CB-Telfer (Rlm4)/ATR-Cobbler (Rlm4) using
  a single-spore isolate of L. maculans, PHW1223. A genetic linkage map of the CB-Telfer/ATR-Cobbler
  population was constructed using 7,932 genotyping-by-sequencing-based DArTseq markers
  and subsequently utilized for linkage and haplotype analyses. Genetic linkage between
  DArTseq markers and resistance to PHW1223 isolate was also validated using the B.
  napus 60K Illumina Infinium array. Our results revealed that a major locus for resistance,
  designated as Rlm13, maps on chromosome C03. To date, no R gene for resistance to
  blackleg has been reported on the C subgenome in B. napus. Twenty-four candidate
  R genes were predicted to reside within the quantitative trait locus (QTL) region.
  We further resequenced both the parental lines of the mapping population (CB-Telfer
  and ATR-Cobbler, textgreater 80 Ã— coverage) and identified several structural sequence
  variants in the form of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), insertions/deletions
  (InDels), and presence/absence variations (PAVs) near Rlm13. Comparative mapping
  revealed that Rlm13 is located within the homoeologous A03/C03 region in ancestral
  karyotype block \"R\" of Brassicaceae. Our results provide a \"target\" for further
  understanding the Avr-Rlm13 gene interaction as well as a valuable tool for increasing
  resistance to blackleg in canola germplasm.'
