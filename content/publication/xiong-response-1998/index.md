abstract: Oxalic acid is a toxin secreted by Sclerotinia sclerotiorum. The activities
  of three enzymes were measured at different time after 10 mmol/L oxalic acid treatment
  during the four leaf stages. The results showed that there were some differences
  in the activities of POD,PPO and S0D between the two rapeseed varieties. The activities
  of the three enzymes in the resistant variety 783 were higher than that of the susceptible
  variety 84039. The activities of POD and SOD in the two rapeseed varieties under
  oxalic acid treament were higer than that in their own check, and the increasing
  extent of the resistant variety was greater than that of the susceptible variety,
  but the activity of the PPO decreased. These results indicated these three enzymes
  played an important role in the resistant reaction to toxin oxalic acid, and they
  might be used as physiological criteria in rapeseed resistant breeding.
