abstract: Key message This research based on RNA-seq, biochemical, and cytological
  analyses sheds that ROS may serve as important signaling molecules of cytoplasmic
  male sterility in CMS-D8 cotton. To understand the mechanism of cytoplasmic male
  sterility in cotton (Gossypium hirsutum), transcriptomic, cytological, and biochemical
  analysis were performed between the cytoplasmic male sterility CMS-D8 line, Zhong41A,
  and its maintainer line Zhong41B. A total of 2335 differentially expressed genes
  (DEGs) were identified in the CMS line at three different stages of anther development.
  Bioinformatics analysis of these DEGs indicated their relationship to reactive oxygen
  species (ROS) homeostasis, including reduction-oxidation reactions and the metabolism
  of glutathione and ascorbate. At the same time, DEGs associated with tapetum development,
  especially the transition to secretory tapetum, were down-regulated in the CMS line.
  Biochemical analysis indicated that the ability of the CMS line to eliminate ROS
  was decreased, which led to the rapid release of H2O2. Cytological analysis revealed
  that the most crucial defect in the CMS line was the abnormal tapetum. All these
  results are consistent with the RNA sequencing data. On the basis of our findings,
  we propose that ROS act as signal molecules, which are released from mitochondria
  and transferred to the nucleus, triggering the formation of abnormal tapetum.
