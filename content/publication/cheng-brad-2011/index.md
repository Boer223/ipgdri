abstract: "BACKGROUND: Brassica species include both vegetable and oilseed crops,\
  \ which are very important to the daily life of common human beings. Meanwhile,\
  \ the Brassica species represent an excellent system for studying numerous aspects\
  \ of plant biology, specifically for the analysis of genome evolution following\
  \ polyploidy, so it is also very important for scientific research. Now, the genome\
  \ of Brassica rapa has already been assembled, it is the time to do deep mining\
  \ of the genome data. DESCRIPTION: BRAD, the Brassica database, is a web-based resource\
  \ focusing on genome scale genetic and genomic data for important Brassica crops.\
  \ BRAD was built based on the first whole genome sequence and on further data analysis\
  \ of the Brassica A genome species, Brassica rapa (Chiifu-401-42). It provides datasets,\
  \ such as the complete genome sequence of B. rapa, which was de novo assembled from\
  \ Illumina GA II short reads and from BAC clone sequences, predicted genes and associated\
  \ annotations, non coding RNAs, transposable elements (TE), B. rapa genes' orthologous\
  \ to those in A. thaliana, as well as genetic markers and linkage maps. BRAD offers\
  \ useful searching and data mining tools, including search across annotation datasets,\
  \ search for syntenic or non-syntenic orthologs, and to search the flanking regions\
  \ of a certain target, as well as the tools of BLAST and Gbrowse. BRAD allows users\
  \ to enter almost any kind of information, such as a B. rapa or A. thaliana gene\
  \ ID, physical position or genetic marker. CONCLUSION: BRAD, a new database which\
  \ focuses on the genetics and genomics of the Brassica plants has been developed,\
  \ it aims at helping scientists and breeders to fully and efficiently use the information\
  \ of genome data of Brassica plants. BRAD will be continuously updated and can be\
  \ accessed through http://brassicadb.org."
