abstract: To understand the sucrose transporter (SUC) gene family expansion and lost
  in Brassicacea plants， a genome － wide search was carried out to identify SUC genes
  in B． rapa，B． oleracea and B． napus． Gene struc- ture，domain feature，and phylogenetic
  relationship were also performed． Based on the gene family characteristics， 12 SUC
  genes in B． rapa，4 in B． oleracea，and 7 in B． napus were identified． Syntenic relationship
  analysis indica- ted that these 3 species experienced different gene loss resulting
  in different gene retention rates． Protein sequence feature showed that they had
  alkaline amino acids for hydrophobic and stable protein structure． Observation of
  tran- scriptomic data indicated that all SUC genes were expressed in the examined
  tissues of root，stem，leaf，flower，si- lique and callus． In conserved motifs of promoter
  regions，a large number of stress － responsive cis － acting ele- ments were found，such
  as LTRE，ABRE，MYC，MYB and W － box，which indicated that SUC genes might be in- volved
  in stress － responsive pathways．
