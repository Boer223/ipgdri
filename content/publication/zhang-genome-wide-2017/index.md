abstract: The GRAS gene family is a large plant-specific family of transcription factors
  that are involved in diverse processes during plant development. Medicago truncatula
  is an ideal model plant for genetic research in legumes, and specifically for studying
  nodulation, which is crucial for nitrogen fixation. In this study, 59 MtGRAS genes
  were identified and classified into eight distinct subgroups based on phylogenetic
  relationships. Motifs located in the C-termini were conserved across the subgroups,
  while motifs in the N-termini were subfamily specific. Gene duplication was the
  main evolutionary force for MtGRAS expansion, especially proliferation of the LISCL
  subgroup. Seventeen duplicated genes showed strong effects of purifying selection
  and diverse expression patterns, highlighting their functional importance and diversification
  after duplication. Thirty MtGRAS genes, including NSP1 and NSP2, were preferentially
  expressed in nodules, indicating possible roles in the process of nodulation. A
  transcriptome study, combined with gene expression analysis under different stress
  conditions, suggested potential functions of MtGRAS genes in various biological
  pathways and stress responses. Taken together, these comprehensive analyses provide
  basic information for understanding the potential functions of GRAS genes, and will
  facilitate further discovery of MtGRAS gene functions.
