abstract: 'Serine/arginine-rich (SR) proteins are indispensable factors for RNA splicing,
  and they play important roles in development and abiotic stress responses. However,
  little information on SR genes in Brassica napus is available. In this study, 59
  SR genes were identified and classified into seven subfamilies: SR, SCL, RS2Z, RSZ,
  RS, SR45, and SC. In each subfamily, the genes showed relatively conserved structures
  and motifs, but displayed distinct expression patterns in different tissues and
  under abiotic stress, which might be caused by the varied cis-acting regulatory
  elements among them. Transcriptome datasets from Pacbio/Illumina platforms showed
  that alternative splicing of SR genes was widespread in B. napus and the majority
  of paralogous gene pairs displayed different splicing patterns. Protein-protein
  interaction analysis indicated that SR proteins were involved in the regulation
  of the whole lifecycle of mRNA, from synthesis to decay. Moreover, the association
  mapping analysis suggested that 12 SR genes were candidate genes for regulating
  specific agronomic traits, which indicated that SR genes could affect the development
  and hence influence the important agronomic traits of B. napus. In summary, this
  study provided elaborate information on SR genes in B. napus, which will aid further
  functional studies and genetic improvement of agronomic traits in B. napus.'
