abstract: Field experiments were carried out to evaluate the resistance of winter
  rapeseed candidate cultivars to Sclerotinia stem rot（by Sclerotinia sclerotiorum）
  by artificial disease nursery between 2009 and 2012.91 candidate cultivars tested
  in the national winter rapeseed regional trials were classified into resistant and
  susceptible groups at 6 levels as high resistant,medium resistant,low resistant,high
  susceptible,medium susceptible and low susceptible.Brassica napus L.cv Zhongyou
  821 was used as control.Two years of experiments showed that only 31 cultivars were
  resistant（low resistant） to the disease.The percentages of resistant cultivars were
  22.73%,37.5%,50%,28.75% and 0 in the 4 trail groups including UY（upper-stream of
  the Yangtze River）,MY（mid-stream of the Yangtze River）,DY（down-stream of the Yangze
  River）,HH（the Huang-Huai River）,and EM（early maturity group） respectively.Among
  them,4 of the 10 pure lines were medium resistant,and 27（about 33.3%） of the 81
  hybrid lines were medium resistant.The low percentages of resistance alerted breeders
  to produce disease resistance winter rapeseed.
