abstract: A variety of mycoviruses have been found in Sclerotinia sclerotiorum. In
  this study, we report a novel mycovirus S. sclerotiorum botybirnavirus 1 (SsBRV1)
  that was originally isolated from the hypovirulent strain SCH941 of S. sclerotiorum.
  SsBRV1 has rigid spherical virions that are âˆ¼38 nm in diameter, and three double-stranded
  RNA (dsRNA) segments (dsRNA1, 2, and 3 with lengths of 6.4, 6.0, and 1.7 kbp, respectively)
  were packaged in the virions. dsRNA1 encodes a cap-pol fusion protein, and dsRNA2
  encodes a polyprotein with unknown functions but contributes to the formation of
  virus particles. The dsRNA3 is dispensable and may be a satellite-like RNA of SsBRV1.
  Although phylogenetic analysis of the RdRp domain demonstrated that SsBRV1 is related
  to Botrytis porri RNA virus 1 (BpRV1) and Ustilago maydis dsRNA virus-H1, the structure
  proteins of SsBRV1 do not have any significant sequence similarities with other
  known viral proteins with the exception of those of BpRV1. SsBRV1 carrying dsRNA3
  seems to have no obvious effects on the colony morphology, but can significantly
  reduce the growth rate and virulence of S. sclerotiorum. These findings provide
  new insights into the virus taxonomy, virus evolution and the interactions between
  SsBRV1 and the fungal hosts.
