abstract: Brassica napus L. is an important oil crop worldwide and is the main raw
  material for biofuel. Seed weight and seed size are the main contributors to seed
  yield. DA1 (DA means big in Chinese) is an ubiquitin receptor and negatively regulates
  seed size. Down-regulation of AtDA1 in Arabidopsis leads to larger seeds and organs
  by increasing cell proliferation in integuments. In this study, BnDA1 was down-regulated
  in B. napus by over expressed of AtDA1R358K , which is a functional deficiency of
  DA1 with an arginine-to-lysine mutation at the 358th amino acid. The results showed
  that the biomass and size of the seeds, cotyledons, leaves, flowers and siliques
  of transgenic plants all increased significantly. In particular, the 1000 seed weight
  increased 21.23% and the seed yield per plant increased 13.22% in field condition.
  The transgenic plants had no negative traits related to yield. The candidate gene
  association analysis demonstrated that the BnDA1 locus was contributed to the seeds
  weight. Therefore, our study showed that regulation of DA1 in B. napus can increase
  the seed yield and biomass, and DA1 is a promising target for crop improvement.
