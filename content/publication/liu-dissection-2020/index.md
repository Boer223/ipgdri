abstract: Glucosinolates (GSLs), whose degradation products have been shown to be
  increasingly important for human health and plant defence, compose important secondary
  metabolites found in the order Brassicales. It is highly desired to enhance pest
  and disease resistance by increasing the leaf GSL content while keeping the content
  low in seeds of Brassica napus, one of the most important oil crops worldwide. Little
  is known about the regulation of GSL accumulation in the leaves. We quantified the
  levels of 9 different GSLs and 15 related traits in the leaves of 366 accessions
  and found that the seed and leaf GSL content were highly correlated (r = 0.79).
  A total of 78 loci were associated with GSL traits, and five common and eleven tissue-specific
  associated loci were related to total leaf and seed GSL content. Thirty-six candidate
  genes were inferred to be involved in GSL biosynthesis. The candidate gene BnaA03g40190D
  (BnaA3.MYB28) was validated by DNA polymorphisms and gene expression analysis. This
  gene was responsible for high leaf/low seed GSL content and could explain 30.62%
  of the total leaf GSL variation in the low seed GSL panel and was not fixed during
  double-low rapeseed breeding. Our results provide new insights into the genetic
  basis of GSL variation in leaves and seeds and may facilitate the metabolic engineering
  of GSLs and the breeding of high leaf/low seed GSL content in B. napus.
