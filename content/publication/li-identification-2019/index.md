abstract: Brassica napus (oilseed rape) is an economically important oil crop worldwide.
  Sclerotinia stem rot (SSR) caused by Sclerotinia sclerotiorum is a threat to oilseed
  rape production. Because the flower petals play pivotal roles in the SSR disease
  cycle, it is useful to express the resistance-related genes specifically in flowers
  to hinder further infection with S. sclerotiorum. To screen flower-specific promoters,
  we first analyzed the transcriptome data from 12 different tissues of the B. napus
  line ZS11. In total, 249 flower-specific candidate genes with high expression in
  petals were identified, and the expression patterns of 30 candidate genes were verified
  by quantitative real-time transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis. Furthermore, two
  novel flower-specific promoters (FSP046 and FSP061 promoter) were identified, and
  the tissue specificity and continuous expression in petals were determined in transgenic
  Arabidopsis thaliana with fusing the promoters to Î²-glucuronidase (GUS)-reporter
  gene. GUS staining, transcript expression pattern, and GUS activity analysis indicated
  that FSP046 and FSP061 promoter were strictly flower-specific promoters, and FSP046
  promoter had a stronger activity. The two promoters were further confirmed to be
  able to direct GUS expression in B. napus flowers using transient expression system.
  The transcriptome data and the flower-specific promoters screened in the present
  study will benefit fundamental research for improving the agronomic traits as well
  as disease and pest control in a tissue-specific manner.
