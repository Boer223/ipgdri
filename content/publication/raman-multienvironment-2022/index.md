abstract: Canola varieties exhibit variation in drought avoidance and drought escape
  traits, reflecting adaptation to water-deficit environments. Our understanding of
  underlying genes and their interaction across environments in improving crop productivity
  is limited. A doubled haploid population was analysed to identify quantitative trait
  loci (QTL) associated with water-use efficiency (WUE) related traits. High WUE in
  the vegetative phase was associated with low seed yield. Based on the resequenced
  parental genome data, we developed sequence-capture-based markers and validated
  their linkage with carbon isotope discrimination (Δ13 C) in an F2 population. RNA sequencing
  was performed to determine the expression of candidate genes underlying Δ13 C QTL.
  QTL contributing to main and QTL × environment interaction effects for Δ13 C and
  yield were identified. One multiple-trait QTL for Δ13 C, days to flower, plant height,
  and seed yield was identified on chromosome A09. Interestingly, this QTL region
  overlapped with a homoeologous exchange (HE) event, suggesting its association with
  the multiple traits. Transcriptome analysis revealed 121 significantly differentially
  expressed genes underlying Δ13 C QTL on A09 and C09, including in HE regions. Sorting
  out the negative relationship between vegetative WUE and seed yield is a priority.
  Genetic and genomic resources and knowledge so developed could improve canola WUE
  and yield.
