abstract: To understand the mechanisms of male sterility in cotton (Gossypium spp.),
  combined histological, biochemical and transcription analysis using RNA-Seq was
  carried out in the anther of the single-gene recessive genic male sterility system
  of male sterile line 1355A and male fertile line 1355B, which are near-isogenic
  lines (NILs) differing only in the fertility trait. A total of 2,446 differentially
  expressed genes were identified between the anthers of 1355AB lines, at three different
  stages of development. Cluster analysis and functional assignment of differentially
  expressed genes revealed differences in transcription associated with pollen wall
  and anther development, including the metabolism of fatty acids, glucose, pectin
  and cellulose. Histological and biochemical analysis revealed that a major cellular
  defect in the 1355A was a thicker nexine, consistent with the RNA-seq data, and
  further gene expression studies implicated differences in fatty acids synthesis
  and metabolism. This study provides insight into the phenotypic characteristics
  and gene regulatory network of the genic male sterile line 1355A in upland cotton.
