abstract: Resistance genes and defense genes of plant, virulence genes of pathogen,
  resistance mechanism to disease, and the gene engineering strategy for resistance
  were chiefly reviewed. The emphasis was put on the general process of resistance
  reaction, the role of cell hydrolyase and toxin of pathogen and the gene engineering
  for resistance to toxin
