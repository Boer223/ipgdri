abstract: As one of the largest classes of lectins, legume lectins have a variety
  of desirable features such as antibacterial and insecticidal activities as well
  as anti-abiotic stress ability. The Sclerotinia disease (SD) caused by the soil-borne
  fungus Sclerotinia sclerotiorum is a devastating disease affecting most oil crops
  such as Brassica napus. Here, we identified 130 legume lectin (LegLu) genes in B.
  napus, which could be phylogenetically classified into seven clusters. The BnLegLu
  gene family has been significantly expanded since the whole-genome duplication (WGD)
  or segmental duplication. Gene structure and conserved motif analysis suggested
  that the BnLegLu genes were well conserved in each cluster. Moreover, relative to
  those genes only containing the legume lectin domain in cluster VI–VII, the genes
  in cluster I–V harbored a transmembrane domain and a kinase domain linked to the
  legume lectin domain in the C terminus. The expression of most BnLegLu genes was
  relatively low in various tissues. Thirty-five BnLegLu genes were responsive to
  abiotic stress, and 40 BnLegLu genes were strongly induced by S. sclerotiorum, with
  a most significant up-regulation of 715-fold, indicating their functional roles
  in SD resistance. Four BnLegLu genes were located in the candidate regions of genome-wide
  association analysis (GWAS) results which resulted from a worldwide rapeseed population
  consisting of 324 accessions associated with SD. Among them, the positive role of
  BnLegLus-16 in SD resistance was validated by transient expression in tobacco leaves.
  This study provides important information on BnLegLu genes, particularly about their
  roles in SD resistance, which may help targeted functional research and genetic
  improvement in the breeding of B. napus.
