abstract: As the fifth family of pathogenesis-related proteins, TLP （thaumatin-like
  protein） plays an important defensive role in the interaction between plant and
  pathogen. In some species, the C-terminal of TLP fused kinase domain, but the fusion
  gene function required to be discussed. In Brassica napus, we identified and cloned
  a gene named BnTLK1, which contained a TLP domain at N termini and serine/ threonine-rich
  receptor-like kinase domain at C termini. Sequence characterization showed that
  BnTLK1 had typical transmembrane structure and formed two independent units at 3D
  structure level. The expression of BnTLK1 was low in different tissues, high expressed
  in the cultivar 'ZY821' of high resistance to Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, and induced
  by S. sclerotiorum based on public transcriptome data analysis. To investigate the
  effect of BnTLK1 on S. sclerotiorum and other fungus, BnTLK1 were expressed in prokaryotic
  system and get the soluble protein BnTLK1 after overnight induction at 0.4 mmol/L
  IPTG and 17℃. Bacteriostatic experiment further confirmed BnTLK1 could indeed inhibit
  the mycelium growth of Sclerotinia sclerotiorum and Botrytis cinerea.
