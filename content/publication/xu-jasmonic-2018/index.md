abstract: Glucosinolate (GSL) is associated with clubroot disease, which is caused
  by the obligate biotrophic protist Plasmodiophora brassicae. Due to the complicated
  composition of GSLs, their exact role in clubroot disease development remains unclear.
  By investigating clubroot disease resistance in cruciferous plants and characterizing
  the GSL content in seeds, we can determine if clubroot disease development is related
  to the components of GSLs. The difference in the infection process between Matthiola
  incana L. (resistant) and Brassica napus L. (susceptible) was determined. Root hair
  infection was definitely observed in both resistant and susceptible hosts, but no
  infection was observed during the cortical infection stage in resistant roots; this
  finding was verified by molecular detection of P. brassicae via PCR amplification
  at various times after inoculation. Based on the time course detection of the contents
  and compositions of GSLs after P. brassicae inoculation, susceptible roots exhibited
  increased accumulation of aliphatic, indolic, and aromatic GSLs in B. napus, but
  only aromatic GSLs were significantly increased in M. incana. Gluconapin, which
  was the main aliphatic GSL in B. napus and present only in B. napus, was significantly
  increased during the secondary infection stage. Quantification of the internal jasmonic
  acid (JA) concentration showed that both resistant and susceptible plants exhibited
  an enhanced level of JA, particularly in susceptible roots. The exogenous JA treatment
  induced aliphatic GSLs in B. napus and aromatic GSLs in M. incana. JA-induced aromatic
  GSLs may be involved in the defense against P. brassicae, whereas aliphatic GSLs
  induced by JA in B. napus likely play a role during the secondary infection stage.
  Three candidate MYB28 genes regulate the content of aliphatic GSLs identified in
  B. napus; one such gene was BnMYB28.1, which was significantly increased following
  both the treatment with exogenous JA and P. brassicae inoculation. In summary, the
  increased content of JA during the secondary infection stage may induce the expression
  of BnMYB28.1, which caused the accumulation of aliphatic GSLs in clubroot disease
  development.
