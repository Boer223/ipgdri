abstract: Multi-functional microRNAs (miRNAs) are emerging as key modulators of plant-pathogen
  interactions. Although the involvement of some miRNAs in plant-insect interactions
  has been revealed, the underlying mechanisms are still elusive. The brown planthopper
  (BPH) is the most notorious rice (Oryza sativa)-specific insect that causes severe
  yield losses each year and requires urgent biological control. To reveal the miRNAs
  involved in rice-BPH interactions, we performed miRNA sequencing and identified
  BPH-responsive OsmiR396. Sequestering OsmiR396 by overexpressing target mimicry
  (MIM396) in three genetic backgrounds indicated that OsmiR396 negatively regulated
  BPH resistance. Overexpression of one BPH-responsive target gene of OsmiR396, growth
  regulating factor 8 (OsGRF8), showed resistance to BPH. Furthermore, the flavonoid
  contents increased in both the OsmiR396-sequestered and the OsGRF8 overexpressing
  plants. By analysing 39 natural rice varieties, the elevated flavonoid contents
  were found to correlate with enhanced BPH resistance. Artificial applications of
  flavonoids to wild type (WT) plants also increased resistance to BPH. A BPH-responsive
  flavanone 3-hydroxylase (OsF3H) gene in the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway was proved
  to be directly regulated by OsGRF8. A genetic functional analysis of OsF3H revealed
  its positive role in mediating both the flavonoid contents and BPH resistance. And
  analysis of the genetic correlation between OsmiR396 and OsF3H showed that down-regulation
  of OsF3H complemented the BPH resistance characteristic and simultaneously decreased
  the flavonoid contents of the MIM396 plants. Thus, we revealed a new BPH resistance
  mechanism mediated by the OsmiR396-OsGRF8-OsF3H-flavonoid pathway. Our study suggests
  potential applications of miRNAs in BPH resistance breeding.
