abstract: Oxalic acid is a toxin produced when plant is attacked by Sclerotinia sclerotiorum.An
  oxalic acid insensitive mutant named 275-7 was screened from the T-DNA insertion
  mutant library of Arabidopsis thaliana（about 1 000 lines） using 1/2 MS with 3 mmol/L
  oxalic acid.In vivo leaf inoculation test was undertaken,in order to assess the
  resistance to Sclerotinia sclerotiorum of mutant 275-7.The result indicated that
  mutant 275-7 exhibited a higher resistance to S.sclerotiorum than the wild type
  Arabidopsis（Ptextless0.05）.Fluorescence real-time quantitative PCR result showed
  that the expression of jasmonic acid（JA）-responsive marker gene PDF1.2 in 275-7
  were significantly up-regulated（12 fold） in comparison with the wild type plants,but
  the expression level of salicylic acid（SA）-responsive marker gene PR1 was not significantly
  different from the wild type.This suggested that the enhanced resistance to S.sclerotiorum
  in mutant 275-7 might be mediated through JA signal pathway.
