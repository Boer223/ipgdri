 abstract = {Among polyploid species with complex genomic architecture, variations in the regulation of alternative splicing (AS) provide opportunities for transcriptional and proteomic plasticity and the potential for generating trait diversities. However, the evolution of AS and its influence on grain development in diploid grass and valuable polyploid wheat crops are poorly understood. To address this knowledge gap, we developed a pipeline for the analysis of alternatively spliced transcript isoforms, which takes the high sequence similarity among polyploid wheat subgenomes into account. Through analysis of synteny and detection of collinearity of homoeologous subgenomes, conserved and specific AS events across five wheat and grass species were identified. A global analysis of the regulation of AS in diploid grass and polyploid wheat grains revealed diversity in AS events not only between the endosperm, pericarp and embryo overdevelopment, but also between subgenomes. Analysis of AS in homoeologous triads of polyploid wheats revealed evolutionary divergence between gene-level and transcript-level regulation of embryogenesis. Evolutionary age analysis indicated that the generation of novel transcript isoforms has occurred in young genes at a more rapid rate than in ancient genes. These findings, together with the development of comprehensive AS resources for wheat and grass species, advance understanding of the evolution of regulatory features of AS during embryogenesis and grain development in wheat.},
