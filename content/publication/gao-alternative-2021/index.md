abstract: Among polyploid species with complex genomic architecture, variations in
  the regulation of alternative splicing (AS) provide opportunities for transcriptional
  and proteomic plasticity and the potential for generating trait diversities. However,
  the evolution of AS and its influence on grain development in diploid grass and
  valuable polyploid wheat crops are poorly understood. To address this knowledge
  gap, we developed a pipeline for the analysis of alternatively spliced transcript
  isoforms, which takes the high sequence similarity among polyploid wheat subgenomes
  into account. Through analysis of synteny and detection of collinearity of homoeologous
  subgenomes, conserved and specific AS events across five wheat and grass species
  were identified. A global analysis of the regulation of AS in diploid grass and
  polyploid wheat grains revealed diversity in AS events not only between the endosperm,
  pericarp and embryo overdevelopment, but also between subgenomes. Analysis of AS
  in homoeologous triads of polyploid wheats revealed evolutionary divergence between
  gene-level and transcript-level regulation of embryogenesis. Evolutionary age analysis
  indicated that the generation of novel transcript isoforms has occurred in young
  genes at a more rapid rate than in ancient genes. These findings, together with
  the development of comprehensive AS resources for wheat and grass species, advance
  understanding of the evolution of regulatory features of AS during embryogenesis
  and grain development in wheat.
