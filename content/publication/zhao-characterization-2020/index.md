abstract: Chlorophyll biosynthesis and chloroplast development are crucial to photosynthesis
  and plant growth, but their regulatory mechanism remains elusive in many crop species.
  We isolated a Brassica napus yellow-virescent leaf (yvl) mutant, which exhibited
  yellow-younger-leaf and virescent-older-leaf with decreased chlorophyll accumulation
  and delayed chloroplast development. We mapped yvl locus to a 70-kb interval between
  molecular markers yvl-O10 and InDel-O6 on chromosome A03 in BC2F2 population using
  whole genome re-sequencing and bulked segregant analysis. The mutant had a 'C' to
  'T' substitution in the coding sequence of BnaA03.CHLH, which encodes putative H
  subunit of Mg-protoporphyrin IX chelatase (CHLH). The mutation resulted in an imperfect
  protein structure and reduced activity of CHLH. It also hampered the plastid encoded
  RNA polymerase which transcribes regulatory genes of photosystem II and I. Consequently,
  the chlorophyll a/b and carotenoid contents were reduced and the chloroplast ultrastructure
  was degraded in yvl mutant. These results explain that a single nucleotide mutation
  in BnaA03.CHLH impairs PEP activity to disrupt chloroplast development and chlorophyll
  biosynthesis in B. napus.
