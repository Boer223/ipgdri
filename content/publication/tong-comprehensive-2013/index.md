abstract: "BACKGROUND: The species Brassica rapa (2n=20, AA) is an important vegetable\
  \ and oilseed crop, and serves as an excellent model for genomic and evolutionary\
  \ research in Brassica species. With the availability of whole genome sequence of\
  \ B. rapa, it is essential to further determine the activity of all functional elements\
  \ of the B. rapa genome and explore the transcriptome on a genome-wide scale. Here,\
  \ RNA-seq data was employed to provide a genome-wide transcriptional landscape and\
  \ characterization of the annotated and novel transcripts and alternative splicing\
  \ events across tissues. RESULTS: RNA-seq reads were generated using the Illumina\
  \ platform from six different tissues (root, stem, leaf, flower, silique and callus)\
  \ of the B. rapa accession Chiifu-401-42, the same line used for whole genome sequencing.\
  \ First, these data detected the widespread transcription of the B. rapa genome,\
  \ leading to the identification of numerous novel transcripts and definition of\
  \ 5'/3' UTRs of known genes. Second, 78.8% of the total annotated genes were detected\
  \ as expressed and 45.8% were constitutively expressed across all tissues. We further\
  \ defined several groups of genes: housekeeping genes, tissue-specific expressed\
  \ genes and co-expressed genes across tissues, which will serve as a valuable repository\
  \ for future crop functional genomics research. Third, alternative splicing (AS)\
  \ is estimated to occur in more than 29.4% of intron-containing B. rapa genes, and\
  \ 65% of them were commonly detected in more than two tissues. Interestingly, genes\
  \ with high rate of AS were over-represented in GO categories relating to transcriptional\
  \ regulation and signal transduction, suggesting potential importance of AS for\
  \ playing regulatory role in these genes. Further, we observed that intron retention\
  \ (IR) is predominant in the AS events and seems to preferentially occurred in genes\
  \ with short introns. CONCLUSIONS: The high-resolution RNA-seq analysis provides\
  \ a global transcriptional landscape as a complement to the B. rapa genome sequence,\
  \ which will advance our understanding of the dynamics and complexity of the B.\
  \ rapa transcriptome. The atlas of gene expression in different tissues will be\
  \ useful for accelerating research on functional genomics and genome evolution in\
  \ Brassica species."
