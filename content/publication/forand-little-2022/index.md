abstract: Cell wall structural modifications through pectin cross-linkages between
  calcium ions and/or boric acid may be key to mitigating dehydration stress and fungal
  pathogens. Water loss was profiled in a pure pectin system and in vivo. While calcium
  and boron reduced water loss in pure pectin standards, the impact on Allium species
  was insignificant (p textgreater 0.05). Nevertheless, synchrotron X-ray microscopy
  showed the localization of exogenously applied calcium to the apoplast in the epidermal
  cells of Allium fistulosum. Exogenous calcium application increased viscosity and
  resistance to shear force in Allium fistulosum, suggesting the formation of calcium
  cross-linkages (\"egg-box\" structures). Moreover, Allium fistulosum (freezing tolerant)
  was also more tolerant to dehydration stress compared to Allium cepa (freezing sensitive).
  Furthermore, the addition of boric acid (H3BO3) to pure pectin reduced water loss
  and increased viscosity, which indicates the formation of RG-II dimers. The Arabidopsis
  boron transport mutant, bor1, expressed greater water loss and, based on the lesion
  area of leaf tissue, a greater susceptibility to Colletotrichum higginsianum and
  Botrytis cinerea. While pectin modifications in the cell wall are likely not the
  sole solution to dehydration and biotic stress resistance, they appear to play an
  important role against multiple stresses.
