abstract: Sclerotinia stem rot (SSR) caused by Sclerotinia sclerotiorum is a devastating
  disease of rapeseed (Brassica napus L.). To date, the genetic mechanisms of rapeseed'
  interactions with S. sclerotiorum are not fully understood, and molecular-based
  breeding is still the most effective control strategy for this disease. Here, Arabidopsis
  thaliana GDSL1 was characterized as an extracellular GDSL lipase gene functioning
  in Sclerotinia resistance. Loss of AtGDSL1 function resulted in enhanced susceptibility
  to S. sclerotiorum. Conversely, overexpression of AtGDSL1 in B. napus enhanced resistance,
  which was associated with increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) and salicylic
  acid (SA) levels, and reduced jasmonic acid levels. In addition, AtGDSL1 can cause
  an increase in lipid precursor phosphatidic acid levels, which may lead to the activation
  of downstream ROS/SA defence-related pathways. However, the rapeseed BnGDSL1 with
  highest sequence similarity to AtGDSL1 had no effect on SSR resistance. A candidate
  gene association study revealed that only one AtGDSL1 homolog from rapeseed, BnaC07g35650D
  (BnGLIP1), significantly contributed to resistance traits in a natural B. napus
  population, and the resistance function was also confirmed by a transient expression
  assay in tobacco leaves. Moreover, genomic analyses revealed that BnGLIP1 locus
  was embedded in a selected region associated with SSR resistance during the breeding
  process, and its elite allele type belonged to a minor allele in the population.
  Thus, BnGLIP1 is the functional equivalent of AtGDSL1 and has a broad application
  in rapeseed S. sclerotiorum-resistance breeding.
