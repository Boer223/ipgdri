abstract: Brassica napus is one of the world's most valuable oilseeds and is under
  constant pressure by the necrotrophic fungal pathogen, Sclerotinia sclerotiorum,
  the causal agent of white stem rot. Despite our growing understanding of host pathogen
  interactions at the molecular level, we have yet to fully understand the biological
  processes and underlying gene regulatory networks responsible for determining disease
  outcomes. Using global RNA sequencing, we profiled gene activity at the first point
  of infection on the leaf surface 24 hours after pathogen exposure in susceptible
  (B. napus cv. Westar) and tolerant (B. napus cv. Zhongyou 821) plants. We identified
  a family of ethylene response factors that may contribute to host tolerance to S.
  sclerotiorum by activating genes associated with fungal recognition, subcellular
  organization, and redox homeostasis. Physiological investigation of redox homeostasis
  was further studied by quantifying cellular levels of the glutathione and ascorbate
  redox pathway and the cycling enzymes associated with host tolerance to S. sclerotiorum.
  Functional characterization of an Arabidopsis redox mutant challenged with the fungus
  provides compelling evidence into the role of the ascorbate-glutathione redox hub
  in the maintenance and enhancement of plant tolerance against fungal pathogens.
