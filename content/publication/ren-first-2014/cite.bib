 abstract = {Shepherd's purse (Capsella bursa-pastoris (L.) Medicus) is an edible and wild medicinal plant widely distributed in China. This plant has been cultivated in Shanghai, China, since the end of the 19th century. Infection of C. bursa-pastoris by Plasmodiophora brassicae, the causal agent of clubroot disease on Brassica spp. has been reported in Korea (2), but is not known to occur in China. In February of 2011, stunted and wilted shepherd's purse (SP) plants were observed in a field planted to oilseed rapes (B. napus) in Sichuan Province of China. Symptomatic SP plants also exhibited root galls. Disease incidence was 6.2% and 100% for SP and B. napus, respectively. Root galls on diseased SP plants were collected for pathogen identification. Many resting spores were observed when the root galls were examined under a light microscope. The resting spores were circular in shape, measuring 2.0 to 3.1 μm in diameter (average 2.6 μm). PCR amplification was conducted to confirm the pathogen. DNA was extracted from root galls and healthy roots (control) of SP. Two primers, TC2F (5'-AAACAACGAGTCAGCTTGAATGCTAGTGTG-3') and TC2R (5'-CTTTAGTTGTGTTTCGGCTAGGATGGTTCG-3') were used to detect P. brassicae (1). No PCR amplifications were observed with the control DNA as template. A fragment of the expected size (approximately 520 bp) was obtained when DNA was amplified from diseased roots of SP. These results suggest that the pathogen in the galled roots of SP is P. brassicae. Pathogenicity of P. brassicae in SP was tested on plants of both SP and Chinese cabbage (CC) (B. campestris ssp. pekinensis). A resting spore suspension prepared from naturally infected SP roots was mixed with a sterilized soil in two plastic pots, resulting in a final concentration of 5 × 106 spores/g soil. Soil treated with the same volume of sterile water was used as a control. Seeds of SP and CC were pre-germinated on moist filter paper for 2 days (20°C) and seeded into the infested and control pots, one seed per pot for planted for CC and four seeds per pot for SP. The pots were placed in a chamber at 15 to 25°C under 12 h light and 12 h dark. Plants in each pot were uprooted after 4 weeks and the roots of each plant were washed under tap water and rated for clubroot disease. No disease symptoms were observed in the control treatments of SP or CC. Plants of both species showed symptoms of clubroot, with the disease incidence of 62.5% and 100% on SP and CC, respectively. The pathogen was isolated from diseased roots of each plant and confirmed as P. brassicae based on morphological characteristics and PCR detection. To our knowledge, this is the first report of clubroot disease on C. bursa-pastoris in Sichuan Province of China. This finding suggests that it may be necessary to manage C. bursa-pastoris in cruciferous vegetable (cabbage, turnip) and oilseed rape production fields. References: (1) T. Cao et al.
