abstract: "Shepherd's purse (Capsella bursa-pastoris (L.) Medicus) is an edible and\
  \ wild medicinal plant widely distributed in China. This plant has been cultivated\
  \ in Shanghai, China, since the end of the 19th century. Infection of C. bursa-pastoris\
  \ by Plasmodiophora brassicae, the causal agent of clubroot disease on Brassica\
  \ spp. has been reported in Korea (2), but is not known to occur in China. In February\
  \ of 2011, stunted and wilted shepherd's purse (SP) plants were observed in a field\
  \ planted to oilseed rapes (B. napus) in Sichuan Province of China. Symptomatic\
  \ SP plants also exhibited root galls. Disease incidence was 6.2% and 100% for SP\
  \ and B. napus, respectively. Root galls on diseased SP plants were collected for\
  \ pathogen identification. Many resting spores were observed when the root galls\
  \ were examined under a light microscope. The resting spores were circular in shape,\
  \ measuring 2.0 to 3.1 μm in diameter (average 2.6 μm). PCR amplification was conducted\
  \ to confirm the pathogen. DNA was extracted from root galls and healthy roots (control)\
  \ of SP. Two primers, TC2F (5'-AAACAACGAGTCAGCTTGAATGCTAGTGTG-3') and TC2R (5'-CTTTAGTTGTGTTTCGGCTAGGATGGTTCG-3')\
  \ were used to detect P. brassicae (1). No PCR amplifications were observed with\
  \ the control DNA as template. A fragment of the expected size (approximately 520\
  \ bp) was obtained when DNA was amplified from diseased roots of SP. These results\
  \ suggest that the pathogen in the galled roots of SP is P. brassicae. Pathogenicity\
  \ of P. brassicae in SP was tested on plants of both SP and Chinese cabbage (CC)\
  \ (B. campestris ssp. pekinensis). A resting spore suspension prepared from naturally\
  \ infected SP roots was mixed with a sterilized soil in two plastic pots, resulting\
  \ in a final concentration of 5 × 106 spores/g soil. Soil treated with the same\
  \ volume of sterile water was used as a control. Seeds of SP and CC were pre-germinated\
  \ on moist filter paper for 2 days (20°C) and seeded into the infested and control\
  \ pots, one seed per pot for planted for CC and four seeds per pot for SP. The pots\
  \ were placed in a chamber at 15 to 25°C under 12 h light and 12 h dark. Plants\
  \ in each pot were uprooted after 4 weeks and the roots of each plant were washed\
  \ under tap water and rated for clubroot disease. No disease symptoms were observed\
  \ in the control treatments of SP or CC. Plants of both species showed symptoms\
  \ of clubroot, with the disease incidence of 62.5% and 100% on SP and CC, respectively.\
  \ The pathogen was isolated from diseased roots of each plant and confirmed as P.\
  \ brassicae based on morphological characteristics and PCR detection. To our knowledge,\
  \ this is the first report of clubroot disease on C. bursa-pastoris in Sichuan Province\
  \ of China. This finding suggests that it may be necessary to manage C. bursa-pastoris\
  \ in cruciferous vegetable (cabbage, turnip) and oilseed rape production fields.\
