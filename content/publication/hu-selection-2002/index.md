abstract: Recent studies have shown that some strains of plant growth promoting rhizobacteria
  (PGPR) can induce disease resistance in plants and stimulate them at the same time.
  Good results have been obtained in the application of good strains for plant growth
  and disease control, but most of these experiments were conducted under artificially
  controlled conditions, and the results of application to field production were very
  unstable or ineffective. Under natural conditions, competition from indigenous microorganisms
  or other adverse environmental factors hinder the growth of the bacteria used, making
  many experiments ineffective. In order to make PGPR work stably and effectively
  in production, it is necessary to strengthen the research of applied basic theory
  and actively take other technical measures. In this study, we attempted to isolate
  and clone the gene of resistance to plant diseases from Pseudomonas aeruginosa and
  Pseudomonas spp. and transfer it into crops for expression to obtain disease-resistant
  plants.
