abstract: '[Objective]The aim was to establish a rapid identification method to determine
  differences in susceptibility of Cercospora Sojina Hara by hyphae inoculated on
  the excised leaf surface.[Method]6 varieties and 2 races（race 1and race 2） were
  used to study the establishment of a rapid identification method to determine differences
  in susceptibility of Cercospora Sojina Hara by hyphae inoculated on the excised
  leaf.[Result]The difference of lesion areas caused by the hyphae on Minimal medium
  was obvious under circumstances of 28 ℃ and 12 hlight per day,and the results were
  in sympathy with reports.[Conclusion]The hyphae inoculation method owns the features
  of non-growingseason restriction,non-circumstance restriction,simplicity and repeatability,so
  it could be an effective method in identifying the resistance to Cercospora Sojina
  Hara.'
