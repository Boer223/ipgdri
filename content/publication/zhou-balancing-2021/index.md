abstract: Interactions and co-evolution between plants and herbivorous insects are
  critically important in agriculture. Brown planthopper (BPH) is the most severe
  insect of rice, and the biotypes adapt to feed on different rice genotypes. Here,
  we present genomics analyses on 1,520 global rice germplasms for resistance to three
  BPH biotypes. Genome-wide association studies identified 3,502 single nucleotide
  polymorphisms (SNPs) and 59 loci associated with BPH resistance in rice. We cloned
  a previously unidentified gene Bph37 that confers resistance to BPH. The associated
  loci showed high nucleotide diversity. Genome-wide scans for trans-species polymorphisms
  revealed ancient balancing selection at the loci. The secondarily evolved insect
  biotypes II and III exhibited significantly higher virulence and overcame more rice
  varieties than the primary biotype I. In response, more SNPs and loci evolved in
  rice for resistance to biotypes II and III. Notably, three exceptional large regions
  with high SNP density and resistance-associated loci on chromosomes 4 and 6 appear
  distinct between the resistant and susceptible rice varieties. Surprisingly, these
  regions in resistant rice might have been retained from wild species Oryza nivara.
  Our findings expand the understanding of long-term interactions between rice and
  BPH and provide resistance genes and germplasm resources for breeding durable BPH-resistant
  rice varieties.
