abstract: 'Virus diseases greatly affect oilseed rape (Brassica napus) production.
  Investigating antiviral genes may lead to the development of disease-resistant varieties
  of oilseed rape. In this study, we examined the effects of the suppressor of gene
  silencing 3 in Brassica napus (BnSGS3, a putative antiviral gene) with different
  genus viruses by constructing BnSGS3-overexpressing (BnSGS3-Ov) and BnSGS3-silenced
  (BnSGS3-Si) oilseed rape (cv. Zhongshuang No. 6) plants. These three viruses are
  Oilseed rape mosaic virus (ORMV), Turnip mosaic virus (TuMV) and Cucumber mosaic
  virus (CMV). The native BnSGS3 expressed in all examined tissues with the highest
  expression in siliques. All three viruses induced BnSGS3 expression, but ORMV induced
  a dramatic increase in the BnSGS3-Ov plants, followed by TuMV and CMV. Upon inoculation
  with three different viruses, transcript abundance of BnSGS3 gene follows: BnSGS3-Ov
  textgreater non-transgenic plants textgreater BnSGS3-Si. The accumulation quantities
  of ORMV and TuMV exhibited a similar trend. However, CMV accumulation showed an
  opposite trend where virus accumulations were negatively correlated with BnSGS3
  expression. The results suggest that BnSGS3 selectively inhibits CMV accumulation
  but promotes ORMV and TuMV accumulation. BnSGS3 should be used in different ways
  (up- and down-regulation) for breeding virus-resistant oilseed rape varieties.'
