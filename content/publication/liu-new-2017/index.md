abstract: We performed molecular cloning and complete genome sequencing of a novel
  mycoreovirus, Sclerotinia sclerotiorumreovirus 1 (SsReV1), isolated from an isolate
  of the phytopathogenic fungus Sclerotinia sclerotiorum. SsReV1 has a genome of 28 055
  bp and is composed of 11 double-stranded RNA segments. With a combination of unique
  molecular features, virion shape and composition, and phylogenetic analysis, SsReV1
  is significantly distinct from all known reoviruses and defines a novel genus in
  the family Reoviridae. Interestingly, two conserved domains, double-stranded RNA
  binding motif (dsRBM, Pfam 00 035) and reovirus sigma C capsid protein (Reo_σC,
  pfam04 582), were identified in the genome of SsReV1, which are widespread in diverse
  virus lineages. Sequence comparison and phylogenetic analysis revealed that multiple
  cross-family horizontal gene transfer (HGT) events could occur between reoviruses
  and double-stranded DNA viruses, single-stranded RNA viruses and even cellular organisms.
  Interestingly, the dsRBM of SsReV1 was phylogenetically related to dsRNA-binding
  proteins of some insects, but not reoviruses. These results indicated that SsReV1
  is a new taxonomic representative in Reoviridae, which provides new insights into
  the diversity and global ecology of reoviruses and other segmented double-stranded
  RNA viruses. More importantly, the present results provided evidence indicating
  that reoviruses indeed have HGT events with other virus lineages on a large scale
  and that HGT may serve as an important driving factor that plays a key role in the
  evolution of reoviruses.
