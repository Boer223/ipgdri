abstract: BnERF104 gene was cloned from Brassica napus cv Zhongshuang 9 using conserved
  primers designed from AtERF104 gene sequence of Arabidopsis.NCBI-BLAST showed BnERF104
  protein had a typical ERF conserved domain,was a member of ETHYLENE-RESPONSE-FACTOR（ERF）
  family.BnERF104 expression was up-regulated significantly at 6h after S.sclerotiorum
  inoculation.Over-expression of BnERF104 in transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana activated
  expressions of pathogenesis-related（PR） gene PDF1.2 and ChiB,and significantly enhanced
  plant resistance to necrotrophic fungi S.sclerotiorum.
