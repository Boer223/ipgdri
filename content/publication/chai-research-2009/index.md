abstract: Plant endo-β-1,4-glucanase genes play an important role in plant growth
  and development.Recently,with continuous development in molecular biology,significant
  progress has been obtained in studies on plant endo-β-1,4-glucanase genes.The paper
  reviews in detail the cloning,functions,expression regulation of plant endo-β-1,4-glucanase
  genes and the structures,substrates of the encoded proteins,which is useful for
  understanding its effect on plant development.
