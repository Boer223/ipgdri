 abstract = {Traits related to flowering time are the most promising agronomic traits that directly impact the seed yield and oil quality of rapeseed (Brassica napus L.). Developing early flowering and maturity rapeseed varieties is an important breeding objective in B. napus. Many studies have reported on days to flowering, but few have reported on budding, bolting, and the interval between bolting and DTF. Therefore, elucidating the genetic architecture of QTLs and genes regulating flowering time, we presented an integrated investigation on SNP and haplotype-based genome-wide association study of 373 diverse B. napus germplasm, which were genotyped by the 60K SNP array and were phenotyped in the four environments. The results showed that a total of 15 and 37 QTLs were detected from SNP and haplotype-based GWAS, respectively. Among them, seven QTL clusters were identified by haplotype-based GWAS. Moreover, three and eight environmentally stable QTLs were detected by SNP-GWAS and haplotype-based GWAS, respectively. By integrating the above two approaches and by co-localizing the four traits, ten (10) genomic regions were under selection on chromosomes A03, A07, A08, A10, C06, C07, and C08. Interestingly, the genomic regions FT.A07.1, FT.A08, FT.C06, and FT.C07 were identified as novel. In these ten regions, a total of 197 genes controlling FT were detected, of which 14 highly expressed DEGs were orthologous to 13 Arabidopsis thaliana genes after integration with transcriptome results. In a nutshell, the above results uncovered the genetic architecture of important agronomic traits related to flowering time and provided a basis for multiple molecular marker-trait associations in B. napus.},
