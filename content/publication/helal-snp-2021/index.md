abstract: Traits related to flowering time are the most promising agronomic traits
  that directly impact the seed yield and oil quality of rapeseed (Brassica napus
  L.). Developing early flowering and maturity rapeseed varieties is an important
  breeding objective in B. napus. Many studies have reported on days to flowering,
  but few have reported on budding, bolting, and the interval between bolting and
  DTF. Therefore, elucidating the genetic architecture of QTLs and genes regulating
  flowering time, we presented an integrated investigation on SNP and haplotype-based
  genome-wide association study of 373 diverse B. napus germplasm, which were genotyped
  by the 60K SNP array and were phenotyped in the four environments. The results showed
  that a total of 15 and 37 QTLs were detected from SNP and haplotype-based GWAS,
  respectively. Among them, seven QTL clusters were identified by haplotype-based
  GWAS. Moreover, three and eight environmentally stable QTLs were detected by SNP-GWAS
  and haplotype-based GWAS, respectively. By integrating the above two approaches
  and by co-localizing the four traits, ten (10) genomic regions were under selection
  on chromosomes A03, A07, A08, A10, C06, C07, and C08. Interestingly, the genomic
  regions FT.A07.1, FT.A08, FT.C06, and FT.C07 were identified as novel. In these
  ten regions, a total of 197 genes controlling FT were detected, of which 14 highly
  expressed DEGs were orthologous to 13 Arabidopsis thaliana genes after integration
  with transcriptome results. In a nutshell, the above results uncovered the genetic
  architecture of important agronomic traits related to flowering time and provided
  a basis for multiple molecular marker-trait associations in B. napus.
