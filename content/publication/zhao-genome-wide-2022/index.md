abstract: Rapeseed, an allotetraploid oil crop, provides vegetable oil for human consumption.
  The growing demand for oilseeds has necessitated the development of rapeseed varieties
  with improved quality. Therefore, a clear understanding of the genetic basis underlying
  the seed oil content (SOC) is required. In this study, a natural population comprising
  204 diverse accessions and recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from Brassica
  napus and Sinapis alba via distant hybridization were collected for genome-wide
  association analysis (GWAS) and quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping of the SOC
  trait, respectively. The variable coefficient of the RIL and natural populations
  ranged from 7.43 to 10.43% and 8.40 to 10.91%. Then, a high-density linkage map
  was constructed based on whole genome re-sequencing (WGS); the map harbored 2,799
  bin markers and covered a total distance of 1,835.21 cM, with an average marker
  interval of 0.66 cM. The QTLs for SOC on chromosome A07 were stably detected in
  both single and multiple environments. Finally, a novel locus qA07.SOC was identified
  as the major QTL for SOC based on the GWAS and RIL populations. In addition, the
  RNA-seq results showed that photosynthesis, lipid biosynthesis proteins, fatty acid
  metabolism, and unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis were significantly different
  between the developed seeds of the two parents of the RIL population. By comparing
  the variation information and expression levels of the syntenic genes within qA07.SOC
  and its syntenic genomic regions, as well as through haplotype analysis via GWAS,
  BnaA07.STR18, BnaA07.NRT1, and BnaA07g12880D were predicted as candidate genes in
  the qA07.SOC interval. These stable QTLs containing candidate genes and haplotypes
  can potentially provide a reliable basis for marker-assisted selection in B. napus
  breeding for SOC.
