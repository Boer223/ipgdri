abstract: Agrobacterium-mediated gene transformation in Brassica crops is a time-con-suming
  and labor-cost method (tissue culture and plant regeneration) in a genotype-depen-dent
  way. Here we described a new method 'in situ pistil delivery (ISPD)' method with
  no tissue culture and adaptive to three Brassica species. Briefly this method can
  be stated as placement of a liquid drop containing binary vector DNA onto the cut
  surface of emasculated and artificial pollinated Brassica stigma. Transformation
  rate (Basta-resistant seedlings per 100 pistils) of different species ranged from
  0.4% to 16.3%. Factors affecting transforma-tion success included timing and buffer
  type. PCR and Southern blot confirmed transgenic events. Reciprocal cross showed
  reporter gene steadily inherited in nuclear transformed pattern. GUS histochemical
  assay of transgenic immature seeds showed stained embroys and endosperm in the same
  seed, indicating DNA delivered through style and integrated into Brassica seed/genome
  after double fertilization.
