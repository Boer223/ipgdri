abstract: Sclerotinia stem rot caused by Sclerotinia sclerotiorum is a devastating
  disease of Brassica crops, but not in rice. The leaves of a rice line, a partial
  resistant (R) and a susceptible (S) Brassica oleracea pool that bulked from a resistance-segregating
  F2 population were employed for transcriptome sequencing before and after inoculation
  by S. sclerotiorum for 6 and 12â€‰h. Distinct transcriptome profiles were revealed
  between B. oleracea and rice in response to S. sclerotiorum. Enrichment analyses
  of GO and KEGG indicated an enhancement of antioxidant activity in the R B. oleracea
  and rice, and histochemical staining exhibited obvious lighter reactive oxygen species
  (ROS) accumulation and cell death in rice and the R B. oleracea as compared to that
  in the S B. oleracea. Significant enhancement of Ca(2+) signalling, a positive regulator
  of ROS and cell death, were detected in S B. oleracea after inoculation, while it
  was significantly repressed in the R B. oleracea group. Obvious difference was detected
  between two B. oleracea groups for WRKY transcription factors, particularly for
  those regulating cell death. These findings suggest diverse modulations on cell
  death in host in response to S. sclerotiorum. Our study provides useful insight
  into the resistant mechanism to S. sclerotiorum.
