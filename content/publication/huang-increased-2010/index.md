abstract: Bn3A06 gene of Brassica napus L.was obviously up-regulated in gene microarray-profiling（cDNA
  microarray） experiments in which plants were infected by Sclerotinia sclerotiorum.The
  homologous gene of Bn3A06 from Arabidopsis thaliana named At3A06 encodes 289 amino
  acids whose function is unknown.Then the At3A06 function was studied using an artificial
  microRNA（amiRNA） expression vector targeting At3A06 after Agrobacterium-mediated
  floral dip transformed into A.thaliana.The vector harbors a bar gene conferring
  herbicide-resistance.There were three T1 transgenic plants obtained by herbicide
  screening and PCR identification.The At3A06 gene expression,detected by real-time
  quantitative PCR,was significantly inhibited in all transgenic plants.When inoculated
  S.sclerotiorum of the detached leaves of T2 plants,higher susceptibility to the
  pathogens was found than that of the non-transgenic plants,which suggested that
  At3A06 gene may play an important role in resistance to S.sclerotiorum.
