abstract: E3 ligases promote protein ubiquitination and degradation, which regulate
  every aspect of eukaryotic life. The Ariadne (ARI) proteins of RBR (ring between
  ring fingers) protein subfamily has been discovered as a group of potential E3 ubiquitin
  ligases. Only a few available research studies show their role in plant adaptations
  processes against the external environment. Presently, the functions of ARI proteins
  are largely unknown in plants. Therefore, in this study, we performed genome-wide
  analysis to identify the ARI gene family and explore their potential importance
  in B. napus. A total of 39 ARI genes were identified in the B. napus genome and
  were classified into three subfamilies (A, B and C) based on phylogenetic analysis.
  The protein-protein interaction networks and enrichment analysis indicated that
  BnARI genes could be involved in endoreduplication, DNA repair, proteasome assembly,
  ubiquitination, protein kinase activity and stress adaptation. The transcriptome
  data analysis in various tissues provided us an indication of some BnARI genes'
  functional importance in tissue development. We also identified potential BnARI
  genes that were significantly responsive towards the abiotic stresses. Furthermore,
  eight BnARI genes were identified as candidate genes for multiple agronomic traits
  through association mapping analysis in B. napus; among them, BnaA02g12100D, which
  is the ortholog of AtARI8, was significantly associated with ten agronomic traits.
  This study provided useful information on BnARI genes, which could aid targeted
  functional research and genetic improvement for breeding in B. napus.
