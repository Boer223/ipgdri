abstract: An allo-cytoplasmic male sterile line, which was developed through somatic
  hybridization between Brassica napus and Sinapis arvensis (thus designated as Nsa
  CMS line), possesses high potential for hybrid production of rapeseed. In order
  to select for restorer lines, fertile plants derived from the same somatic hybridization
  combination were self-pollinated and testcrossed with the parental Nsa CMS line
  for six generations. A novel disomic alien addition line, B. napus-S. arvensis,
  has been successfully developed. GISH analysis showed that it contains one pair
  of chromosomes from S. arvensis and 19 pairs from B. napus, and retains stable and
  regular mitotic and meiotic processes. The addition line displays very strong restoration
  ability to Nsa CMS line, high resistance to Sclerotinia sclerotiorum and a low incidence
  of pod shattering. Because the addition line shares these very important agricultural
  characters, it is a valuable restorer to Nsa CMS line, and is named NR1 here (Nsa
  restorer no. 1).
