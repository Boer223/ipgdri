abstract: Resistance to charcoal rot （ Macrophomina phaseolina ） and fusarium wilt
  （F. oxysporium ） of 8 new sesame lines and 85 accessions primarily selected during
  Eighth-Five years-Plan were evaluated in three ecological experimental sites of
  main sesame producing provinces. Local varieties widely planted in sesame production
  were used as control. 34 accessions resistant to charcoal rot with relative disease
  indextextless15%, 38 accessions resistant to fusarium wilt and 27 accessions resistant
  to both diseases were selected. Resistance and application potential of disease
  resistant sesame germplasm were elucidated. Isoenzyme analysis results showed that
  there were bands similarity and differences between disease resistant and susceptible
  accessions in zone A.
