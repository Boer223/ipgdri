abstract: Using real-time quantitative PCR,we detected the lipoxygenase2 gene（LOX2）
  expression levels in Brassica napus after treatment with Methyl jasmonate（MeJA）,Benzothiadiazole（BTH）
  or Sclerotinia sclerotiorum.The results indicated that LOX2 expression was induced
  by MeJA and suppressed by salicylic acid analogues BTH.After 24 hours of MeJA treatment,LOX2
  expression level reached the maximum which was 30.3 fold higher than untreated control.Furthermore,expression
  levels of LOX2 were detected in three varieties of oilseed rape inoculated with
  S.sclerotiorum.The results showed that LOX2 was significantly induced after incubation
  with S.sclerotiorum for 72 hours.With regard to high-resistant variety D083,middle-resistant
  variety ZS9 and high-susceptible variety 84039,expression levels of LOX2 were 5-fold,2.7-fold
  and 1.7-fold correspondingly higher than non-incubation plants.These studies suggested
  that the high expression of LOX2 in oilseed rape may play a key role in defense
  against S.sclerotioru,and LOX2 may be involved in JA-mediated defense against S.sclerotiorum.
