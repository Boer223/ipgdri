abstract: The lack of resistant source has greatly restrained resistance breeding
  of rapeseed (Brassica napus, AACC) against Sclerotinia sclerotiorum which causes
  severe yield losses in rapeseed production all over the world. Recently, several
  wild Brassica oleracea accessions (CC) with high level of resistance have been identified
  (Mei et al. in Euphytica 177:393-400, 2011), bringing a new hope to improve Sclerotinia
  resistance of rapeseed. To map quantitative trait loci (QTL) for Sclerotinia resistance
  from wild B. oleracea, an F2 population consisting of 149 genotypes, with several
  clones of each genotypes, was developed from one F1 individual derived from the
  cross between a resistant accession of wild B. oleracea (B. incana) and a susceptible
  accession of cultivated B. oleracea var. alboglabra. The F2 population was evaluated
  for Sclerotinia reaction in 2009 and 2010 under controlled condition. Significant
  differences among genotypes and high heritability for leaf and stem reaction indicated
  that genetic components accounted for a large portion of the phenotypic variance.
  A total of 12 QTL for leaf resistance and six QTL for stem resistance were identified
  in 2 years, each explaining 2.2-28.4 % of the phenotypic variation. The combined
  effect of alleles from wild B. oleracea reduced the relative susceptibility by 22.5
  % in leaves and 15 % in stems on average over 2 years. A 12.8-cM genetic region
  on chromosome C09 of B. oleracea consisting of two major QTL intervals for both
  leaf and stem resistance was assigned into a 2.7-Mb genomic region on chromosome
  A09 of B. rapa, harboring about 30 putative resistance-related genes. Significant
  negative corrections were found between flowering time and relative susceptibility
  of leaf and stem. The association of flowering time with Sclerotinia resistance
  is discussed.
