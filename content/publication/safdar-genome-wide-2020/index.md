abstract: 'Cadmium (Cd) toxicity is a serious threat to future food security and health
  safety. To identify genetic factors contributing to Cd uptake in wheat, we conducted
  a genome-wide association study with genotyping from 90K SNP array. A spring wheat
  diversity panel was planted under normal conditions and Cd stress (50 mg Cd/kg soil).
  The impact of Cd stress on agronomic traits ranged from a reduction of 16% in plant
  height to 93% in grain iron content. Individual genotypes showed a considerable
  variation for Cd uptake and translocation subdividing the panel into three groups:
  (1) hyper-accumulators (i.e. high Leaf_Cd and low Seed_Cd ), (2) hyper-translocators
  (i.e. low Leaf_Cd and high Seed_Cd ), and (3) moderate lines (i.e. low Leaf_Cd and
  low Seed_Cd ). Two lines (SKD-1 and TD-1) maintained an optimum grain yield under
  Cd stress and were therefore considered as Cd resistant lines. Genome-wide association
  identified 179 SNP-trait associations for various traits including 16 for Cd uptake
  at a significance level of P textless .001. However, only five SNPs were significant
  after applying multiple testing correction. These loci were associated with seed-cadmium,
  grain-iron, and grain-zinc: qSCd-1A, qSCd-1D, qZn-2B1, qZn-2B2, and qFe-6D. These
  five loci had not been identified in the previously reported studies for Cd uptake
  in wheat. These loci and the underlying genes should be further investigated using
  molecular biology techniques to identify Cd resistant genes in wheat.'
