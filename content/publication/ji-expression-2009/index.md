abstract: The expressions of PDF1.2, a key gene in the jasmonic acid (JA)/ethylene
  (ET)-dependent signaling pathway, were measured in oxalate oxidase (OXO) transgenic
  and non-transgenic oilseed rapes (Brassica napus) by RT-PCR. The results showed
  that the expression of PDF1.2 was up-regulated in different OXO transgenic oilseed
  rape lines, which indicated that the mechanism of disease resistance to Sclerotinia
  sclerotiorum was related to the induction of the JA/ET-dependent signaling pathway.
