abstract: Brassica napus is a recent allopolyploid derived from the hybridization
  of Brassica rapa (Ar Ar ) and Brassica oleracea (Co Co ). Because of the high sequence
  similarity between the An and Cn subgenomes, it is difficult to provide an accurate
  landscape of the whole transcriptome of B. napus. To overcome this problem, we applied
  a single-molecule long-read isoform sequencing (Iso-Seq) technique that can produce
  long reads to explore the complex transcriptome of B. napus at the isoform level.
  From the Iso-Seq data, we obtained 147 698 non-redundant isoforms, capturing 37 403
  annotated genes. A total of 18.1% (14 934/82 367) of the multi-exonic genes showed
  alternative splicing (AS). In addition, we identified 549 long non-coding RNAs,
  the majority of which displayed tissue-specific expression profiles, and detected
  7742 annotated genes that possessed isoforms containing alternative polyadenylation
  sites. Moreover, 31 591 AS events located in open reading frames (ORFs) lead to
  potential protein isoforms by in-frame or frameshift changes in the ORF. Illumina
  RNA sequencing of five tissues that were pooled for Iso-Seq was also performed and
  showed that 69% of the AS events were tissue-specific. Our data provide abundant
  transcriptome resources for a transcript isoform catalog of B. napus, which will
  facilitate genome reannotation, strengthen our understanding of the B. napus transcriptome
  and be applied for further functional genomic research.
