abstract: In an attempt to determine the adaptation strategy to phosphorous (Pi) deficiency
  in oilseed rape, comparative proteome analyses were conducted to investigate the
  differences of metabolic changes in two oilseed rape genotypes with different tolerance
  to low phosphorus (LP). Generally in either roots or leaves, there existed few low
  phosphorus (LP)-induced proteins shared in the two lines. The LP-tolerant genotype
  102 maintained higher Pi concentrations than LP-sensitive genotype 105 when growing
  hydroponically under the 5-Î¼M phosphorus condition. In 102 we observed the downregulation
  of the proteins related to gene transcription, protein translation, carbon metabolism,
  and energy transfer in leaves and roots, and the downregulation of proteins related
  to leaf growth and root cellular organization. But the proteins related to the formation
  of lateral root were upregulated, such as the auxin-responsive family proteins in
  roots and the sucrose-phosphate synthase-like protein in roots and leaves. On the
  other hand, the LP-sensitive genotype 105 maintained the low level of Pi concentrations
  and suffered high oxidative pressure under the LP condition, and stress-shocking
  proteins were pronouncedly upregulated such as the proteins for signal transduction,
  gene transcription, secondary metabolism, universal stress family proteins, as well
  as the proteins involved in lipid oxygenation and the disease resistance in both
  leaves and roots. Although the leaf proteins for growth in 105 were downregulated,
  the protein expressions in roots related to glycolysis and tricarboxylic acid (TCA)
  cycle were enhanced to satisfy the requirement of organic acid secretion.
