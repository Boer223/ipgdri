abstract: 【Objective】 The study was to determine the effect of BnWRI1 gene on oil
  content of oilseed rape seed.【Method】 RT-PCR was employed to isolate a 384 bp fragment
  from the coding region of BnWRI1,which was then inserted into the RNAi vector of
  pG?4ARi in both forward and reverse directions to form a plant expression vector
  pG?4ARi-WRI1.The vector was introduced into oilseed rape cv.Zhongshuang 9 via pollen-tube
  pathway method.【Result】 Three transgenic plants were confirmed by PCR and Southern
  Blot analysis that the foreign fragment integrated into the plant genomes.BnWRI1
  transcript levels and seed oil contents were detected by semi-quantitative RT-PCR
  and improved Soxhlet extraction,respectively.The results showed that BnWRI1 expression
  was inhibited and seed oil content drastically decreased in each transgenic plant
  compared with non-transgenic plants.【Conclusion】 Silencing endogenous BnWRI1 by
  RNAi can decrease seed oil content,which suggested BnWRI1 could effectively regulate
  seed oil content in oilseed rape.
