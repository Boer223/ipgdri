abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Brassica oleracea encompass a family of vegetables and cabbage
  that are among the most widely cultivated crops. In 2009, the B. oleracea Genome
  Sequencing Project was launched using next generation sequencing technology. None
  of the available maps were detailed enough to anchor the sequence scaffolds for
  the Genome Sequencing Project. This report describes the development of a large
  number of SSR and SNP markers from the whole genome shotgun sequence data of B.
  oleracea, and the construction of a high-density genetic linkage map using a double
  haploid mapping population. RESULTS: The B. oleracea high-density genetic linkage
  map that was constructed includes 1,227 markers in nine linkage groups spanning
  a total of 1197.9 cM with an average of 0.98 cM between adjacent loci. There were
  602 SSR markers and 625 SNP markers on the map. The chromosome with the highest
  number of markers (186) was C03, and the chromosome with smallest number of markers
  (99) was C09. CONCLUSIONS: This first high-density map allowed the assembled scaffolds
  to be anchored to pseudochromosomes. The map also provides useful information for
  positional cloning, molecular breeding, and integration of information of genes
  and traits in B. oleracea. All the markers on the map will be transferable and could
  be used for the construction of other genetic maps.'
