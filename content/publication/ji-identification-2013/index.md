abstract: Williams system was used to identify main physiological races of Plasmodiophora
  brassicae,the pathogen of oilseed rape（Brassica napus L.） clubroot from 19 main
  disease regions.Results indicated that at least 3 races（as Race 2,4 and 13） existed
  in China.Race 4 was dominant in 16 locations,including Zhijiang and Dangyang of
  Hubei Province,She County of Anhui Province,4 counties of Yunnan Province,5 counties
  of Sichuan Province.Race 13 and 2 were distributed in Qiyunshan Town and Shangshan
  Town of Anhui Province,respectively.Resistance of 52 oilseed cultivars to clubroot
  was evaluated under field conditions in Zhijiang and Huangshan.Results showed 10
  cultivars（as Ganliangyou 3,Rongyou 9,Zheshuang 6,Huayouza 12,Zhongyou 5628,Yangyou
  8,Ningyou 12,Zheyou 28,Zhongshuang 10 and Fengyou 520） were resistant to Race 4
  in Zhijiang,and 3 hybrid cultivars（as Chengyouza 6,De 68-12 and Chuzayou 3） were
  resistant to Race 13 in Huangshan.These cultivars were recommended as predominant
  cultivars and breeding materials in clubroot infected regions.
