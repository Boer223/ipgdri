abstract: Fourteen and twelve bacterial strains were isolated and purified from oilseed
  rape rhizosphere of resistant and susceptible varieties, respectively. Of them,
  six strains from the resistant variety Zhongyou821 have antagonistic activity against
  mycelia of Sclerotinia sclerotiorum. The isolate tu 100 strongly inhibited the disease
  lesion development in rape detached leaves and reduced the lesion area by 64.3%.
  The strain significantly promoted rape seedling growth in an aquiculture test and
  dry weight of seedlings increased by 36.4% when compared with control without bacterium
  treatment in 90d.
