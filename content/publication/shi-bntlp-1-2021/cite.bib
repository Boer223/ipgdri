 abstract = {BnTLP1 gene was previously found highly expressed in tolerant Brassica napus cv. Zhongyou 821. To deep understand the tolerance to Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, BnTLP1 gene was identified using overexpressed transgenic Arabidopsis lines. Leaf inoculation was carried out using BnTLP1 overexpression transgenic Arabidopsis lines, wild-type and tlp1-1 mutant by S. sclerotiorum mycelial agar plugs. Compared to WT, BnTLP1 overexpression lines exhibited the smallest lesion, while tlp1-1 showed the largest one, suggesting that BnTLP1 could positively regulated Sclerotinia disease resistance. Subcellular localization indicated that BnTLP1 was located in cell membrane and nucleus. Expression analysis of marker genes in different defense signaling showed that jasmonic acid/ethylene might play roles in the early stage of BnTLP1-mediated diseased resistance.},
