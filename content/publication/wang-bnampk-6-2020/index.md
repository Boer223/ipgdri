abstract: Sclerotinia sclerotiorum causes a devastating disease in oilseed rape (Brassica
  napus), resulting in major economic losses. Resistance response of B. napus against
  S. sclerotiorum exhibits a typical quantitative disease resistance (QDR) characteristic,
  but the molecular determinants of this QDR are largely unknown. In this study, we
  isolated a B. napus mitogen-activated protein kinase gene, BnaMPK6, and found that
  BnaMPK6 expression is highly responsive to infection by S. sclerotiorum and treatment
  with salicylic acid (SA) or jasmonic acid (JA). Moreover, overexpression (OE) of
  BnaMPK6 significantly enhances resistance to S. sclerotiorum, whereas RNAi in BnaMPK6
  significantly reduces this resistance. These results showed that BnaMPK6 plays an
  important role in defense to S. sclerotiorum. Furthermore, expression of defense
  genes associated with SA-, JA- and ethylene (ET)-mediated signaling was investigated
  in BnaMPK6-RNAi, WT and BnaMPK6-OE plants after S. sclerotiorum infection, and consequently,
  it was indicated that the activation of ET signaling by BnaMPK6 may play a role
  in the defense. Further, four BnaMPK6-encoding homologous loci were mapped in the
  B. napus genome. Using the allele analysis and expression analysis on the four loci,
  we demonstrated that the locus BnaA03.MPK6 makes an important contribution to QDR
  against S. sclerotiorum. Our data indicated that BnaMPK6 is a previously unknown
  determinant of QDR against S. sclerotiorum in B. napus.
