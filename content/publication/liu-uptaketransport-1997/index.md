abstract: Uptake, transport and distribution of oxalate by rapeseed excised leaves
  and their relations with varietal resistance ic stem rot （Sclerotinia sclerotiorum）
  were investigated. The excised leaves were fed 14C-oxalate through petioles for
  4 hours under the condition of 20±0. 2℃ and 6000Lux light. 14C-oxalate concentrations
  and specific radioactivity were 5mmol/L and 5μCi/ml. Radioactivity in leaves were
  determined by scintillation counting. The results showed that there was significant
  uptake of 14C-oxalate by leaves. Autoradiographic profile of leaves showed that
  radioactivity in resistant varieties was confined to major veins of leaves and stems,
  and that activity in the interveinal tissue was low, whereas in susceptible varieties
  radioactivity was distributed rather uniformly throughout the leaves. The total
  amount of radioactive substances was more in resistant varieties than in susceptible
  ones. These might be one of mechanisms of resistance to stem rot in rapeseed plant.
