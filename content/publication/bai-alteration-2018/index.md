abstract: Methionine (Met) synthesized from aspartate is a fundamental amino acid
  needed to produce S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) that is an important cofactor for the
  methylation of monolignols. As a competitive inhibitor of SAM-dependent methylation,
  the effect of S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) on lignin biosynthesis, however, is still
  largely unknown in plants. Expression levels of Cystathionine γ-synthase (PvCGS)
  and S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase 1 (PvSAHH1) were down-regulated by RNAi technology,
  respectively, in switchgrass, a dual-purpose forage and biofuel crop. The transgenic
  switchgrass lines were subjected to studying the impact of SAH on lignin biosynthesis.
  Our results showed that down-regulation of PvCGS in switchgrass altered the accumulation
  of aspartate-derived and aromatic amino acids, reduced the content of SAH, enhanced
  lignin biosynthesis and stunted plant growth. In contrast, down-regulation of PvSAHH1
  raised SAH levels in switchgrass, impaired the biosynthesis of both guaiacyl and
  syringyl lignins and therefore significantly increased saccharification efficiency
  of cell walls. This work indicates that SAH plays a crucial role in monolignol methylation
  in switchgrass. Genetic regulation of either PvCGS or PvSAHH1 expression in switchgrass
  can change intracellular SAH contents and SAM to SAH ratios and therefore affect
  lignin biosynthesis. Thus, our study suggests that genes involved in Met metabolism
  are of interest as new valuable targets for cell wall bioengineering in future.
