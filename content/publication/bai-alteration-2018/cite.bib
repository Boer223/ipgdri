 abstract = {Methionine (Met) synthesized from aspartate is a fundamental amino acid needed to produce S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) that is an important cofactor for the methylation of monolignols. As a competitive inhibitor of SAM-dependent methylation, the effect of S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) on lignin biosynthesis, however, is still largely unknown in plants. Expression levels of Cystathionine γ-synthase (PvCGS) and S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase 1 (PvSAHH1) were down-regulated by RNAi technology, respectively, in switchgrass, a dual-purpose forage and biofuel crop. The transgenic switchgrass lines were subjected to studying the impact of SAH on lignin biosynthesis. Our results showed that down-regulation of PvCGS in switchgrass altered the accumulation of aspartate-derived and aromatic amino acids, reduced the content of SAH, enhanced lignin biosynthesis and stunted plant growth. In contrast, down-regulation of PvSAHH1 raised SAH levels in switchgrass, impaired the biosynthesis of both guaiacyl and syringyl lignins and therefore significantly increased saccharification efficiency of cell walls. This work indicates that SAH plays a crucial role in monolignol methylation in switchgrass. Genetic regulation of either PvCGS or PvSAHH1 expression in switchgrass can change intracellular SAH contents and SAM to SAH ratios and therefore affect lignin biosynthesis. Thus, our study suggests that genes involved in Met metabolism are of interest as new valuable targets for cell wall bioengineering in future.},
