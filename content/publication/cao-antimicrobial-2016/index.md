abstract: Lipid transfer protein（ LTP） play an important role in plant defense. In
  this study,Bn LTP1 gene was cloned from Brassica napus L. It harbored 93 bp,encoding
  31- amino acids with molecular weight of 3. 4 k Da.The gene was synthesized artificially
  by overlap polymerase chain reaction（ PCR） and cloned into the prokaryotic expression
  vector ET30 a / His- EDDIE- GFP. Its peptide Bn LTP1 was expressed in Escherichia
  coli BL21. Antimicrobial activity demonstrated that Bn LTP1 exhibited strong antimicrobial
  activity against Gram- positive bacteria,Gram- negative bacteria and yeast. Bn LTP1
  also had strong antifungal activity against several plant pathogenic fungi,including
  Sclerotinia sclerotiorum,Magnaporthe oryzae and Botrytis cinerea.
