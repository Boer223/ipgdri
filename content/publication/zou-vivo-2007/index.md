abstract: Oxalic acid (OA), a non-host-specific toxin secreted by Sclerotinia sclerotiorum
  during pathogenesis, has been demonstrated to be a major phytotoxic and pathogenic
  factor. Oxalate oxidase (OXO) is an enzyme associated with the detoxification of
  OA, and hence the introduction of an OXO gene into oilseed rape (Brassica napus
  L.) to break down OA may be an alternative way of increasing the resistance of the
  plant to Sclerotinia sclerotiorum. In order to investigate the activation of OXO
  in transgenic oilseed rape, a convenient and accessible method was used to monitor
  changes in pH in response to stress induced by OA. The pH sensor, a platinum microcylinder
  electrode modified using polyaniline film, exhibited a linear response within the
  pH range from 3 to 7, with a Nernst response slope of 70 mV/pH at room temperature.
  The linear correlation coefficient was 0.9979. Changes induced by OA in the pH values
  of leaf tissue of different oilseed rape species from Brassica napus L. were monitored
  in real time in vivo using this electrode. The results clearly showed that the transgenic
  oilseed rape was more resistant to OA than non-transgenic oilseed rape.
