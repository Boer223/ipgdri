abstract: Based on previous microarray result of Brassica napus（heterozygous pairs
  of dominant male sterile line） and Arabidopsis thaliana genome,a differentially
  expressed B.napus gene Bn19070 which demonstrated high homology with At2g19070 emerged.It
  was well expressed in fertile stem with low expression level in male sterile stem.To
  understand Bn19070’s function,amiRNA（artificial microRNA） gene silencing technique
  was used to disable the function of homologous gene At2g19070.Two interference targets
  from At2g19070 mRNA were selected and transformed into Arabidopsis.amiRNAi（amiRNA
  interference） phenotypes related to male sterility were observed in transgenic Arabidopsis,including
  decreased microspore number,deteriorated anther and fruitless.Expressions of both
  targets decreased remarkably（more than 90%） in T2 lines with similar phenomena.Results
  indicated the flexibility of amiRNAi in target site selection.The interference research
  of At2g19070 would contribute to Bn19070 gene study.
