abstract: Epimedium brevicornum Maxim (EbM) is a perennial herb grown in China for
  traditional Chinese medicines. Grey mould symptoms were observed on EbM leaves in
  several fields in Hubei Province, China, from April to June in 2015, 2016 and 2017.
  V-shaped blights or concentric rings appeared initially on the basal leaves, followed
  by necrosis gradually spreading from the tips and margins to the entire leaf. Severely
  infected leaves were rolled or distorted and became brittle. A fungal isolate, MF468110,
  was recovered from diseased plants and identified as Botrytis cinerea based on its
  morphological features and sequence analysis of multiple genes. The colony on potato
  dextrose agar was initially white with abundant fluffy aerial mycelia and turned
  grey with numerous irregular black sclerotia. Sequence analysis of the G3PDH, RPB2
  and HSP60 genes found high similarity with other reference strains representing
  the species B. cinerea. Pathogenicity tests showed that the symptoms were similar
  on EbM leaves after inoculation with a conidial suspension and the re-isolated fungi
  were morphologically similar to the isolates used for inoculation, indicating that
  the isolate MF468110 was pathogenic to EbM. This is the first report of B. cinerea
  causing grey mould on EbM in China.
