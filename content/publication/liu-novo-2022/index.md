abstract: To address the global demand for rapeseed while considering farmers’ profit,
  we face the challenges of making a quantum leap in seed yield and, at the same time,
  reducing yield loss due to biotic and abiotic stresses. We also face the challenge
  of efficiently applying new transformative biotechnology tools such as gene editing
  and breeding by genome design to increase rapeseed productivity and profitability.
  In this Perspective, we review advances in research on the physiological and genetic
  bases of both stress factors-affected yield stability and seed yield potential,
  focusing on source–sink relationships and allocation of photosynthetic assimilates
  to vegetative growth and seed development. We propose research directions and highlight
  the role of plant architecture in the relative contributions of the root system,
  leaves, and pods to seed yield. We call for de novo design of new rapeseed crops.
  We review trait variation in existing germplasm and biotechnologies available for
  crop design. Finally, we discuss opportunities to apply fundamental knowledge and
  key germplasm to rapeseed production and propose an ideotype for de novo design
  of future rapeseed cultivars.
