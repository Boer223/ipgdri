abstract: To better understand the relationship between flowering time and Sclerotinia
  sclertiorum resistance of rapeseed,related gene Bn VRN2 was cloned and explored
  in resistant and suspective B. napus bred lines M083（ resistant,bloomed late） and
  888- 5（ susceptible,bloomed earlier）. Expression levels in both M083 and 888- 5
  after S. sclertiorum inoculation were also tested. Results showed that Bn VRN2 gene
  had 2 copies in B. napus,respectively named Bn VRN2a（ located on A8 chromosome）
  and Bn VRN2b（ located on C8 chromosome）. Bn VRN2 a sequences were found different
  between the 2 lines（ which named Bn VRN2a- M and Bn VRN2a- 8 respectively）,while
  Bn VRN2 b sequences were the same. The size of coding sequence（ CDS） of Bn VRN2
  a was 1 278 bp（ encoding 425 amino acids） in M083 and 1 284 bp（ encoding 427 amino
  acids） in 888- 5. 12 SNP mutations and 6 bp insertion / deletion fragments were
  found among the 2 lines. Nucleotide sequence variation resulted in 7 amino acid
  changes,and the 100 th amino acid variation existed in zinc finger motifs of Bn
  VRN2 a. Bn VRN2 a expression in M083 and 888- 5 were different before and after
  S. sclertiorum inoculation. Results suggested that Bn VRN2 a was not only involved
  in flowering related pathway,but also participated in plant resistance against S.
  sclertiorum.
