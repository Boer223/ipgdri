abstract: Proline-rich antimicrobial peptides (PR-AMPs) are a group of cationic host
  defense peptides that are characterized by a high content of proline residues. Up
  to now, they have been reported in some insects, vertebrate and invertebrate animals,
  but are not found in plants. In this study, we performed an in silico screening
  of antimicrobial peptides, which led to discovery of a Brassica napus gene encoding
  a novel PR-AMP. This gene encodes a 35-amino acid peptide with 13 proline residues,
  designated BnPRP1. BnPRP1 has 40.5% identity with a known proline-rich antimicrobial
  peptide SP-B from the pig. BnPRP1 was artificially synthetized and cloned into the
  prokaryotic expression vector pET30a/His-EDDIE-GFP. Recombinant BnPRP1 was produced
  in Escherichia coli and has a predicted molecular mass of 3.8 kDa. Analysis of its
  activity demonstrated that BnPRP1 exhibited strong antimicrobial activity against
  Gram-positive bacterium, Gram-negative bacterium, yeast and also had strong antifungal
  activity against several pathogenic fungi, such as Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, Mucor
  sp., Magnaporthe oryzae and Botrytis cinerea. Circular dichroism (CD) revealed the
  main secondary structure of BnPRP1 was the random coil. BnPRP1 gene expression detected
  by qRT-PCR is responsive to pathogen inoculation. At 48 hours after S. sclerotiorum
  inoculation, the expression of BnPRP1 increased significantly in the susceptible
  lines while slight decrease occurred in resistant lines. These suggested that BnPRP1
  might play a role in the plant defense response against S. sclerotiorum. BnPRP1
  isolated from B. napus was the first PR-AMP member that was characterized in plants,
  and its homology sequences were found in some other Brassicaceae plants by the genome
  sequences analysis. Compared with the known PR-AMPs, BnPRP1 has the different primary
  sequences and antimicrobial activity. Above all, this study gives a chance to cast
  a new light on further understanding about the AMPs' mechanism and application.
