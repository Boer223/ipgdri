abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Brassica oleracea is a morphologically diverse species in the
  family Brassicaceae and contains a group of nutrition-rich vegetable crops, including
  common heading cabbage, cauliflower, broccoli, kohlrabi, kale, Brussels sprouts.
  This diversity along with its phylogenetic membership in a group of three diploid
  and three tetraploid species, and the recent availability of genome sequences within
  Brassica provide an unprecedented opportunity to study intra- and inter-species
  divergence and evolution in this species and its close relatives. DESCRIPTION: We
  have developed a comprehensive database, Bolbase, which provides access to the B.
  oleracea genome data and comparative genomics information. The whole genome of B.
  oleracea is available, including nine fully assembled chromosomes and 1,848 scaffolds,
  with 45,758 predicted genes, 13,382 transposable elements, and 3,581 non-coding
  RNAs. Comparative genomics information is available, including syntenic regions
  among B. oleracea, Brassica rapa and Arabidopsis thaliana, synonymous (Ks) and non-synonymous
  (Ka) substitution rates between orthologous gene pairs, gene families or clusters,
  and differences in quantity, category, and distribution of transposable elements
  on chromosomes. Bolbase provides useful search and data mining tools, including
  a keyword search, a local BLAST server, and a customized GBrowse tool, which can
  be used to extract annotations of genome components, identify similar sequences
  and visualize syntenic regions among species. Users can download all genomic data
  and explore comparative genomics in a highly visual setting. CONCLUSIONS: Bolbase
  is the first resource platform for the B. oleracea genome and for genomic comparisons
  with its relatives, and thus it will help the research community to better study
  the function and evolution of Brassica genomes as well as enhance molecular breeding
  research. This database will be updated regularly with new features, improvements
  to genome annotation, and new genomic sequences as they become available. Bolbase
  is freely available at http://ocri-genomics.org/bolbase.'
