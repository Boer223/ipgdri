abstract: Sclerotinia sclerotiorum causes a highly destructive disease in oilseed
  rape (Brassica napus). Oxalic acid (OA) secreted by the pathogen is a key pathogenicity
  factor. Oxalate oxidase (OXO) can oxidize OA into CO2 and H2O2. In this study, we
  show that transgenic oilseed rape (sixth generation lines) constitutively expressing
  wheat (Triticum aestivum) OXO displays considerably increased OXO activity and enhanced
  resistance to S. sclerotiorum (with up to 90.2 and 88.4% disease reductions compared
  with the untransformed parent line and a resistant control, respectively). Upon
  application of exogenous OA, the pH values in transgenic plants were maintained
  at levels slightly lower than 5.58 measured prior to OA treatment, whereas the pH
  values in untransformed plants decreased rapidly and were markedly lower than 5.63
  measured prior to OA treatment. Following pathogen inoculation, H2O2 levels were
  higher in transgenic plants than in untransformed plants. These results indicate
  that the enhanced resistance of the OXO transgenic oilseed rape to Sclerotinia is
  probably mediated by OA detoxification. We believe that enhancing the OA metabolism
  of oilseed rape in this way will be an effective strategy for improving resistance
  to S. sclerotiorum.
