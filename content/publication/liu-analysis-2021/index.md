abstract: In comparison with retrotransposons, DNA transposons make up a smaller proportion
  of most plant genomes. However, these elements are often proximal to genes to affect
  gene expression depending on the activity of the transposons, which is largely reflected
  by the activity of the transposase genes. Here, we show that three AT-rich introns
  were retained in the TNP2-like transposase genes of the Bot1 (Brassica oleracea
  transposon 1) CACTA transposable elements in Brassica oleracea, but were lost in
  the majority of the Bot1 elements in Brassica rapa. A recent burst of transposition
  of Bot1 was observed in B. oleracea, but not in B. rapa. This burst of transposition
  is likely related to the activity of the TNP2-like transposase genes as the expression
  values of the transposase genes were higher in B. oleracea than in B. rapa. In addition,
  distinct populations of small RNAs (21, 22 and 24 nt) were detected from the Bot1
  elements in B. oleracea, but the vast majority of the small RNAs from the Bot1 elements
  in B. rapa are 24 nt in length. We hypothesize that the different activity of the
  TNP2-like transposase genes is likely associated with the three introns, and intron
  loss is likely reverse transcriptase mediated. Furthermore, we propose that the
  Bot1 family is currently undergoing silencing in B. oleracea, but has already been
  silenced in B. rapa. Taken together, our data provide new insights into the differentiation
  of transposons and their role in the asymmetric evolution of these two closely related
  Brassica species.
