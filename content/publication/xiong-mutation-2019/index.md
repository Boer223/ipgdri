abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Maize brown midrib (bm) mutants associated with impaired lignin
  biosynthesis are a potential source for the breed of novel germplasms with improved
  cell wall digestibility. The spontaneous bm5 mutants had been identified since 2008.
  However, the gene responsible for the bm5 locus, and the comprehensive effects of
  bm5 mutation on lignin biosynthesis, soluble phenolics accumulation, and cell wall
  degradation have yet to be elucidated. RESULTS: The bm5 locus was identified to
  encode a major 4-coumarate: coenzyme A ligase (Zm4CL1) through analyzing MutMap-assisted
  gene mapping data. Two alleles of Zm4CL1 isolated from bm5 mutants contained two
  transposons inserted in the first exon and the second intron, respectively, and
  consequently, the activities of 4CLs in the crude enzyme extracts from bm5 midribs
  were reduced by 51-62% compared with the wild type. Furthermore, five 4CLs were
  retrieved from maize genome, and Zm4CL1 was the most highly expressed one in the
  lignified tissues. Mutation of Zm4CL1 mainly impeded the biosynthesis of guaiacyl
  (G) lignins and increased the level of soluble feruloyl derivatives without impacting
  maize growth and development. Moreover, both neutral detergent fiber digestibility
  and saccharification efficiency of cell walls were significantly elevated in the
  bm5 mutant. CONCLUSIONS: Zm4CL1 was identified as the Bm5 gene, since two independent
  alleles of Zm4CL1 were associated with the same mutant phenotype. Mutation of Zm4CL1
  mainly affected G lignin biosynthesis and soluble feruloyl derivatives accumulation
  in maize lignified tissues. The reduced recalcitrance of the bm5 mutant suggests
  that Zm4CL1 is an elite target for cell wall engineering, and genetic manipulation
  of this gene will facilitate the utilization of crop straw and stover that have
  to be dealt with for environmental protection.'
