abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Oil crop seeds are important sources of fatty acids (FAs) for
  human and animal nutrition. Despite their importance, there is a lack of an essential
  bioinformatics resource on gene transcription of oil crops from a comparative perspective.
  In this study, we developed ocsESTdb, the first database of expressed sequence tag
  (EST) information on seeds of four large-scale oil crops with an emphasis on global
  metabolic networks and oil accumulation metabolism that target the involved unigenes.
  DESCRIPTION: A total of 248,522 ESTs and 106,835 unigenes were collected from the
  cDNA libraries of rapeseed (Brassica napus), soybean (Glycine max), sesame (Sesamum
  indicum) and peanut (Arachis hypogaea). These unigenes were annotated by a sequence
  similarity search against databases including TAIR, NR protein database, Gene Ontology,
  COG, Swiss-Prot, TrEMBL and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG). Five
  genome-scale metabolic networks that contain different numbers of metabolites and
  gene-enzyme reaction-association entries were analysed and constructed using Cytoscape
  and yEd programs. Details of unigene entries, deduced amino acid sequences and putative
  annotation are available from our database to browse, search and download. Intuitive
  and graphical representations of EST/unigene sequences, functional annotations,
  metabolic pathways and metabolic networks are also available. ocsESTdb will be updated
  regularly and can be freely accessed at http://ocri-genomics.org/ocsESTdb/ . CONCLUSION:
  ocsESTdb may serve as a valuable and unique resource for comparative analysis of
  acyl lipid synthesis and metabolism in oilseed plants. It also may provide vital
  insights into improving oil content in seeds of oil crop species by transcriptional
  reconstruction of the metabolic network.'
