abstract: Systemic fungicides and antifungals are used as frontline treatments for
  fungal diseases in plants and humans. It is generally accepted that fungicides will
  bring significant negative side-effects to the environment and result in fungicide
  resistance in the pathogenic fungi. Although previous research has focused on fungicide
  application rates and fungal resistance for a long time, little attention has been
  paid to fungicide residues after treatment, especially their potential role in fungal
  growth and sporulation. Here we investigated the effect of fungicides at sublethal
  concentrations on fungal sporulation. The results showed that two kinds of 14Î±-demethylase
  inhibitors (DMIs) fungicides increased the number of isolates of Colletotrichum
  spp. to sporulate on PDA. Both on PDA medium and plant tissue, low concentration
  of DMI fungicides could promote spore production of Colletotrichum spp., whereas
  pyraclostrobin, a quinone outside inhibitor (QoIs), had no significant effects on
  sporulation of Colletotrichum spp. Transcriptomic analysis suggested that the DMIs
  fungicide stress signal may be transmitted to the central regulatory pathway through
  the FluG-mediated signalling pathway, and further confirmed the morphological effect
  of DMI fungicide on promoting sporulation of Colletotrichum. To our knowledge, this
  is the first study to provide insights into the reproductive response of fungi in
  response to fungicide stress. Our findings indicate that fungicides have two-way
  effects on the growth and reproduction of pathogenic fungi and provide a new basis
  for the scientific and rational use of fungicides.
