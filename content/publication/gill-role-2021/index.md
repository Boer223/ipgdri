abstract: The proteins of membrane transporters (MTs) are embedded within membrane-bounded
  organelles and are the prime targets for improvements in the efficiency of water
  and nutrient transportation. Their function is to maintain cellular homeostasis
  by controlling ionic movements across cellular channels from roots to upper plant
  parts, xylem loading and remobilization of sugar molecules from photosynthesis tissues
  in the leaf (source) to roots, stem and seeds (sink) via phloem loading. The plant’s
  entire source-to-sink relationship is regulated by multiple transporting proteins
  in a highly sophisticated manner and driven based on different stages of plant growth
  and development (PG&D) and environmental changes. The MTs play a pivotal role in
  PG&D in terms of increased plant height, branches/tiller numbers, enhanced numbers,
  length and filled panicles per plant, seed yield and grain quality. Dynamic climatic
  changes disturbed ionic balance (salt, drought and heavy metals) and sugar supply
  (cold and heat stress) in plants. Due to poor selectivity, some of the MTs also
  uptake toxic elements in roots negatively impact PG&D and are later on also exported
  to upper parts where they deteriorate grain quality. As an adaptive strategy, in
  response to salt and heavy metals, plants activate plasma membranes and vacuolar
  membrane-localized MTs that export toxic elements into vacuole and also translocate
  in the root’s tips and shoot. However, in case of drought, cold and heat stresses,
  MTs increased water and sugar supplies to all organs. In this review, we mainly
  review recent literature from Arabidopsis, halophytes and major field crops such
  as rice, wheat, maize and oilseed rape in order to argue the global role of MTs
  in PG&D, and abiotic stress tolerance. We also discussed gene expression level changes
  and genomic variations within a species as well as within a family in response to
  developmental and environmental cues.
