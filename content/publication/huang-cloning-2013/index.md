abstract: In order to find new plant antibacterial peptide,whole genome of Brassica
  napus was scanned and analyzed by means of bioinformatics.A gene of BnPCD842895
  obtained as the preliminary candidate,which had the similar sequence as the known
  antimicrobial peptides.The BnPCD842895 gene is 189bp long,encoding 48 amino acids.The
  complete gene was synthesized artificially through the overlap polymerase chain
  reaction（PCR）,and was cloned into pET30a-EDDIE-GFP expression vector.The inclusion
  was expressed in Escherichia coli.After in vitro protein renaturation process and
  self-cleavage of fusion protein EDDIE,antibacterial peptide product was obtained
  without amino acid wastage.Bacteriostatic activity detection results showed that
  BnPCD842895 had strong bacteriostatic activity both for Gram positive bacteria and
  Gram negative bacteria.
