abstract: Rice blast disease caused by Magnaporthe oryzae is initiated by the attachment
  of conidia to plant surfaces. Germ tubes emerging from conidia develop melanized
  appressoria to physically penetrate the host surface. Previous studies revealed
  that appressorium development requires the breakdown of storage lipids and glycogen
  that occur in peroxisomes and the cytosol respectively, culminating in production
  of pyruvate. However, the downstream product(s) entering the mitochondria for further
  oxidation is unclear. In this study, we aimed to investigate the molecular basis
  underlying the metabolic flux towards the mitochondria associated with the infectious-related
  development in M. oryzae. We showed that D-lactate is a key intermediate metabolite
  of the mobilization of lipids and glycogen, and its oxidative conversion to pyruvate
  is catalysed by a mitochondrial D-lactate dehydrogenase MoDLD1. Deletion of MoDLD1
  caused defects in conidiogenesis and appressorium formation, and subsequently the
  loss of fungal pathogenicity. Further analyses demonstrated that MoDLD1 activity
  is involved in the maintenance of redox homeostasis during conidial germination.
  Thus, MoDLD1 is a critical modulator that channels metabolite flow to the mitochondrion
  coupling cellular redox state, and contributes to development and virulence of M.
  oryzae.
