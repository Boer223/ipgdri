abstract: Currently,the lack of EST sequence information has limited the discovery
  of sesame EST-SSR primer number.All the 45 569 EST sequences of high oil content
  sesame species Zhongzhi14 were obtained from a full-length developing seeds cDNA
  library and assembled 32 421 unigenes.The unigenes represented about 17.428 Mb of
  genic sequences.Using MISA and SSR finder software to screening SSRs,1 949 non-redundant（NR）
  SSRs were identified in 1 688 uniESTs.A total of 226 sequences contained more than
  one SSR.The trinucleotide repeats are the dominant types with the frequency of 74%.All
  of the designed 34 SSR primer pairs related to oil synthesis genes could amplify
  characteristic SSR fragments against 12 different oil content species,and 3 primer
  pairs amplified polymorphic fragments.The EST-SSR markers of sesame are highly efficiency,and
  should be the ideal tools for studies of genetic variation,genetic diversity,and
  development of genetic linkage maps of sesame.
