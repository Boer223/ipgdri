abstract: Bacterial － type PEPC genes were cloned from four oil crops (rape，soybean，peanut
  and sesame)． Their sequences of conserved domains (BOX I to BOX IV) and PEPC activity
  sites were characterized． The genes included Bna10093361，Bna1009749 and Bna10093360
  from Brassica napus， Glyma10g34970． 1， Gly- ma01g22840． 1 and Glyma02g14500． 1 from
  Glycine max，SIN1018296 from Sesamum indicum，AhPPC5 from Ara- chis hypogaea． The
  8 genes were commonly composed of 19 to 21 introns，and contained one unique and
  highly di- vergent insertion of about 356 to 600bp． PEPC sequences had R /KNTG in
  C － terminal tetrapeptide，but lacked the phosphorylation motif at N terminus． Results
  from RT － qPCR showed that Bna10093360 expressed with less than 0． 1% of rapeseed
  BnaActin，Glyma10g34970． 1 and Glyma02g14500． 1 expressed with less than 2% of soy-
  bean GlymaActin． AhPPC5 expressed 32% to 175% of peanut AhActin，and SIN1018296 expressed
  3% to 18% of sesame SINActin． The expression trends of AhPPC5 and SIN1018296 were
  higher at early seed developing stage and then decreased． Results indicated that
  the bacterial － type PEPC gene functions were widely differentiated．
