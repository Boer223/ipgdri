abstract: The Sclerotinia disease, caused by the Sclerotinia sclerotiorum fungi, is
  an important disease in most of cruciferous plants including Brassica napus. The
  disease has a serious impact on the yield quality of B. napus. In this study, we
  screened a Sclerotinia gene, named Ss160 (Sscle04g035160) based on the transcriptome
  analysis, and we found that Ss160 was highly expressed in S. sclerotiorum when inoculated
  them on leaves of B. napus.The bioin⁃ formatics analysis indicated that Ss160 contained
  a signal peptide and the amino sequence were well-conserved across the species in
  the fungi. The subcellular location of Ss160 was not specific. Furthermore, the
  tobacco leaves transient expressed of Ss160, showed significant smaller disease
  lesion size than the comparison, suggesting that het⁃ erologous expression of Ss160
  in plant can enhance its Sclerotinia disease resistance. We further verified the
  tran⁃ script activation activity of Ss160 by yeast proteins interaction system in
  vitro. Our results lay the foundation for fur⁃ ther research of the functional mechanisms
  of Ss160, and also provide the reference for Sclerotinia disease resis⁃ tance study
  in B. napus.
