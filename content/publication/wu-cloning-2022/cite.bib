 abstract = {The Sclerotinia disease, caused by the Sclerotinia sclerotiorum fungi, is an important disease in most
of cruciferous plants including Brassica napus. The disease has a serious impact on the yield quality of B. napus. In this study, we screened a Sclerotinia gene, named Ss160 (Sscle04g035160) based on the transcriptome analysis, and we found that Ss160 was highly expressed in S. sclerotiorum when inoculated them on leaves of B. napus.The bioin⁃ formatics analysis indicated that Ss160 contained a signal peptide and the amino sequence were well-conserved across the species in the fungi. The subcellular location of Ss160 was not specific. Furthermore, the tobacco leaves transient expressed of Ss160, showed significant smaller disease lesion size than the comparison, suggesting that het⁃ erologous expression of Ss160 in plant can enhance its Sclerotinia disease resistance. We further verified the tran⁃ script activation activity of Ss160 by yeast proteins interaction system in vitro. Our results lay the foundation for fur⁃ ther research of the functional mechanisms of Ss160, and also provide the reference for Sclerotinia disease resis⁃ tance study in B. napus.},
