abstract: The potential infection biology of Plasmodiophora brassicae in resistant
  hosts and non-hosts is still not completely understood. Clubroot resistance assay
  on European clubroot differentials (ECD) set revealed that ECD10 (Brassica napus)
  and ECD4 (Brassica rapa) show a complete resistance to the tested P. brassicae isolate
  in contrast to highly susceptible hosts Westar (B. napus) and ECD5 (B. rapa). Previously,
  we used fluorescent probe-based confocal microscopy (FCM) to refine the life cycle
  of P. brassicae and indicate the important time points during its infection in Arabidopsis.
  Here, we used FCM to systematically investigate the infection of P. brassicae in
  two resistant host species ECD10 and ECD4 and two non-host crops wheat and barley
  at each indicated time points, compared with two susceptible hosts Westar and ECD5.
  We found that P. brassicae can initiate the primary infection phase and produce
  uninucleate primary plasmodia in both resistant hosts and non-hosts just like susceptible
  hosts at 2 days post-inoculation (dpi). Importantly, P. brassicae can develop into
  zoosporangia and secondary zoospores and release the secondary zoospores from the
  zoosporangia in resistant hosts at 7 dpi, comparable to susceptible hosts. However,
  during the secondary infection phase, no secondary plasmodium was detected in the
  cortical cells of both resistant hosts in contrast to massive secondary plasmodia
  present in the cortex tissue of two susceptible hosts leading to root swelling at
  15 dpi. In both non-host crops, only uninucleate primary plasmodia were observed
  throughout roots at 7 and 15 dpi. Quantitative PCR based on DNA revealed that the
  biomass of P. brassicae has no significant increase from 2 dpi in non-host plants
  and from 7 dpi in resistant host plants, compared to the huge biomass increase in
  susceptible host plants from 2 to 25 dpi. Our study reveals that the primary infection
  phase in the root epidermis and the secondary infection phase in the cortex tissue
  are, respectively, blocked in non-hosts and resistant hosts, contributing to understanding
  of cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying clubroot non-host and host resistance.
