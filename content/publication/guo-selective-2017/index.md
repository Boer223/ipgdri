abstract: 'It has been well documented that most nuclear protein-coding genes in organisms
  can be classified into two categories: positively selected genes (PSGs) and negatively
  selected genes (NSGs). The characteristics and evolutionary fates of different types
  of genes, however, have been poorly understood. In this study, the rates of nonsynonymous
  substitution (Ka ) and the rates of synonymous substitution (Ks ) were investigated
  by comparing the orthologs between the two sequenced Brassica species, Brassica
  rapa and Brassica oleracea, and the evolutionary rates, gene structures, expression
  patterns, and codon bias were compared between PSGs and NSGs. The resulting data
  show that PSGs have higher protein evolutionary rates, lower synonymous substitution
  rates, shorter gene length, fewer exons, higher functional specificity, lower expression
  level, higher tissue-specific expression and stronger codon bias than NSGs. Although
  the quantities and values are different, the relative features of PSGs and NSGs
  have been largely verified in the model species Arabidopsis. These data suggest
  that PSGs and NSGs differ not only under selective pressure (Ka /Ks ), but also
  in their evolutionary, structural and functional properties, indicating that selective
  modes may serve as a determinant factor for measuring evolutionary rates, gene compactness
  and expression patterns in Brassica.'
