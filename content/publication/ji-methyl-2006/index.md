abstract: This research showed that methyl jasmonate（MeJA）、benzothiadiazole（BTH） and
  low concentration oxalic acid（OA） can induce resistance to Sclerotinia sclerotiorum
  in Brassica napus with expression of systemic resistance being later than that of
  local resistance.In the concentration scale tested,the effect of different MeJA
  or OA concentrations on induced resistance was not significant,but too low concentration
  can not induce systemic resistance（e.g.0.01mmol/L MeJA） and high concentration OA
  was pathogenic,which caused symptom like that caused by Sclerotinia sclerotiorum.Trypan
  blue staining showed that the growth of fungal hyphae was abnormal（e.g.thicker and
  distorted）,which indicated that the mycelia growth was suppressed in induced leaves
  by MeJA、BTH or low concentration OA.
