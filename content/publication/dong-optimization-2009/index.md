abstract: Proteins from buds anthers and leaves were extracted using TCA(trich looaceticacid)-acetone
  method frm sterile and fertile plants of Brassica napusLdam inant GMS (genic male
  sterile) line Shaan-GMs Optinized factors inchuded extraction paranetersypes of
  IPG strip focusing procedure gel concen tration and loading quantity of samples.High
  quality2-DEmap with low background was obtained using the following optinized procedure:dissolving
  proteins with lysis sohution (7mol/L Urea 2mol/L Thoure 4% CHAPS 65mmol DTT 0.5%IPG
  buffer pH 3~10 or pH 4~7,10mL.Camplete Protease Inh ib itor Coctail Tab lets for
  each sample), load ing 150ug protein sample isoelectric focusing with IEFâ…¡ procedure
  (30v,12h; 200v, h; 500v, 1h; 1 000v, 0.5h; 10 000V,2h;10 000V,8h),SDS-PAGEwith 10%
  gel concentrationand finally detecting proteins using silvertaining method.The optin
  ized system will be able to facilitate the proteam ics research on B.napus
