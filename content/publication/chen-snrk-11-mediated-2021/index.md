abstract: Plants have evolved a series of strategies to combat pathogen infection.
  Plant SnRK1 is probably involved in shifting carbon and energy use from growth-associated
  processes to survival and defence upon pathogen attack, enhancing the resistance
  to many plant pathogens. The present study demonstrated that SnRK1.1 enhanced the
  resistance of Arabidopsis thaliana to clubroot disease caused by the plant-pathogenic
  protozoan Plasmodiophora brassicae. Through a yeast two-hybrid assay, glutathione
  S-transferase pull-down assay, and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assay,
  a P. brassicae RxLR effector, PBZF1, was shown to interact with SnRK1.1. Further
  expression level analysis of SnRK1.1-regulated genes showed that PBZF1 inhibited
  the biological function of SnRK1.1 as indicated by the disequilibration of the expression
  level of SnRK1.1-regulated genes in heterogeneous PBZF1-expressing A. thaliana.
  Moreover, heterogeneous expression of PBZF1 in A. thaliana promoted plant susceptibility
  to clubroot disease. In addition, PBZF1 was found to be P. brassicae-specific and
  conserved. This gene was significantly highly expressed in resting spores. Taken
  together, our results provide new insights into how the plant-pathogenic protist
  P. brassicae employs an effector to overcome plant resistance, and they offer new
  insights into the genetic improvement of plant resistance against clubroot disease.
