abstract: Clubroot caused by Plasmodiophora brassicae is an increasingly important
  soilborne disease in China. The host range of P. brassicae was investigated with
  30 cruciferous plants, including 16 crop species, 9 ornamentals, and 5 weeds in
  field and pot-cultured conditions. In the field, 17 species from five genera produced
  visible galls, and these included radish, Capsella bursa-pastoris, Orychophragmus
  violaceus, Sinapis alba, and 13 Brassica crops. In pot-cultured conditions, an additional
  13 plant species (11 genera) were determined to be hosts of P. brassicae. Five common
  weeds were found to be hosts of P. brassicae, including C. bursa-pastoris, Lepidium
  apetalum, Descurainia sophia, S. alba, and Thellungiella salsuginea. The infection
  of these plants was confirmed via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with primers specific
  to P. brassicae. No galls were found on Matthiola incana roots in the field or in
  pots and no resting spores of P. brassicae were observed in M. incana roots, although
  P. brassicae was detected in M. incana roots via PCR. Microscopic examination revealed
  infection only in the root hairs of M. incana roots. These results suggested that
  M. incana was highly resistant to P. brassicae in China and could be developed as
  a bait crop. In total, 297 accessions of oilseed rape were tested in the field,
  and 3 accessions of Brassica napus and 1 accession of B. juncea were found to be
  highly resistant to clubroot disease. These resistant resources provide options
  for managing clubroot in P. brassicae-infested fields.
