abstract: In order to analysis resistant ability of Rs to Sclerotinia sclerotiorum,Rs
  was artificial synthesized and combined with a rice α- Amylase signal peptide αAmy3SP
  which can cargo proteins to plastids and intercellular space of plant cells to construct
  plant expression vector 35S- SP- Rs and 35S- SP- GFP. Gene gun bombardment onion
  experiment showed that fluorescent signal of GFP existed in the extracellular matrix
  between cell wall and membrane. This result illustrated that GFP was effectively
  transported as cargo into extracellular matrix under the guide of 35 S and αAmy3SP.
  Rs gene was introduced into Arabidopsis via Agrobacterium tumefaciens- mediated
  transformation. 35 positive p35S- SP- Rs transgenic plantlets were obtained by PCR
  assay and kanamycin selection. Relative expression level of Rs in transgenic Arabidopsis
  was much higher than that of WT lines as detected by qRT- PCR with normal growth
  and development. Disease resistance identification showed that Rs transgenic plants
  had higher resistance to S. Sclerotiorum than non- transgenic plants. This study
  showed that the presence of high amount of antimicrobial peptide Rs in extracellular
  matrix could reduce cytotoxicity and enhance resistance of plants to S. sclerotiorum
  by significantly inhibiting extension of fungal hyphae.
